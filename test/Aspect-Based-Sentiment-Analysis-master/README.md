# Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis

This repository tries to implement Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis on SemEval 2014 dataset. It is a part of course project of the course CS671: Introduction to Natural Language Processing. The approach followed here is mainly dependent on the paper "Aspect extraction for opinion mining with a deep convolutional neural network" published by Soujanya Poria, Erik Cambria and Alexander Gelbukh in Knowledge-Based Systems.
