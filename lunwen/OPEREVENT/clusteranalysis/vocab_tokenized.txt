boston ap universities across the nation say president donald trump’s ban on travelers from seven muslim countries is disrupting vital research projects and academic exchanges in such fields as medicine public health and engineering with untold numbers of scholars blocked from entering the u.s. for years schools in the u.s. have worked to widen exchanges with scholars in the middle east and especially iran known for its strength in math and science but many academics worry those bridges are now in jeopardy because of the ban against iran iraq syria somalia sudan libya and yemen some fear the u.s. will lose its standing as the world leader in research and innovation “it’s terrifying said sarah knuckey director of the human rights clinic at columbia law school “we’re damaging international research including on issues like health and medicine.” students in knuckey’s clinic have been working with a think tank in yemen to explore the health consequences of the country’s civil war inviting scholars to lecture and planning a conference in new york this year because of the travel ban they are trying to move the event to canada research between the u.s. and the seven countries covers a wide range of fields according to the national institutes of health u.s. and iranian researchers have teamed up to study cancer heart disease hepatitis and opiate addiction navid madani an hiv researcher at harvard medical school said collaboration with scientists in iran has been crucial to her work much of that cooperation is now in question one of her counterparts in iran was scheduled to teach at harvard this year but may be prevented from entering the country “i’ve tried to balance my anger and despair with resolve said madani who was born in iran and is now a naturalized u.s. citizen “this is something that really has to be reversed.” an iranian researcher working on his ph.d. in italy was refused check-in at a milan airport monday while trying to travel to california nima enayati had obtained a visa to conduct research on robotic surgery at stanford university “it is rather disappointing to know that you will not be able at least physically to have more collaboration with them he said “and we will see how it is going to affect our work.” at indiana university-purdue university indianapolis officials were planning to welcome the first class of iranian graduate students into a new engineering program in partnership with the university of tehran now it’s on hold because the students can’t secure visas “these are the best and the brightest they have made tremendous sacrifices to be able to come to the united states said gil latz the university’s associate vice chancellor for international affairs “in the stroke of a pen their future hopes and dreams are being questioned or brought to a halt.” overall colleges and universities in the u.s. hosted about students from the seven banned countries last year a fourfold increase over the past decade of those here last year more than were from iran many of the students and researchers here are now stuck in the u.s. afraid they won’t be allowed back in if they leave to visit home or travel to academic conferences others who were planning to come here are now blocked seyed soheil saeedi saravi a scientist from iran said he realized a childhood dream when he received a cardiology fellowship at harvard he was scheduled to arrive days after the travel ban was put in place but found that his visa is now suspended indefinitely “i only can say iranians are really sad depressed and somewhat angry he said in an email in response to the ban thousands of academics abroad have signed an online petition boycotting academic conferences in the u.s some conferences are being pressured to relocate outside america meanwhile dozens of college presidents have called on trump to reverse the ban “this is not only unbefitting a country built by immigrants on the ideals of liberty and equality but it is also a self-inflicted wound that will damage the very innovation that lies at the root of our nation’s prosperity said angel cabrera president of george mason university nicholas dirks chancellor at the university of california-berkeley said the ban gives an advantage to countries that compete with the u.s. for scholars “allowing them to replace this country as the prime destination for the most talented students and researchers would cause irreparable damage and help them to achieve their goal of global leadership he wrote some academics say the ban will simply leave the u.s. out of future research caroline wagner who studies global collaboration in science at ohio state university said the number of papers published by co-authors in different countries has grown dramatically since in alone academics from iran and the u.s. teamed up on more than published papers “international collaboration is increasingly the way science is done wagner said “we can not assume that leadership and science belong to the united states.” this story has been corrected to fix the spelling of sarah knuckey’s first name associated press reporter colleen barry contributed from milan

skip to comments key lawmaker downplays threat to cpb funding npr/pbs current jan dru sefton posted on by drango the chair of a key house appropriations subcommittee said that the forthcoming white house budget should take aim at bigger deficit reduction targets than the relatively small appropriations for cpb and two endowments supporting arts and humanities even if the trump administration does target cpb in its first budget the corporation would most likely survive the challenge said rep. tom cole r-okla. because there is a strong constituency for public broadcasting in both the house and senate. cole heads the subcommittee on labor health and human services education and related agencies which handles funding for cpb the national endowment for the arts and the national endowment for the humanities in an interview monday he said appropriations for all three are only a small portion of the billion in federal spending that his committee oversees cpbs fiscal million appropriation along with million for each of the endowments total less than million a budget blueprint circulated by the conservative heritage foundation during the general election calls for eliminating appropriations to all three an anonymously sourced story in the hill reported that trumps team is following that template it calls for privatization of cpb and defunding both arts agencies in its response to the jan. article cpb described the proposal as nothing new similar ideas have been circulating around washington for years and have been soundly rejected on a bipartisan basis most recently by the republican-controlled house of representatives in the statement said cole criticized the proposal for pragmatic reasons we cant balance a budget by going after relatively small items he said if this administration is serious about deficit reduction then we have to talk about entitlement programs so far the administration is unwilling to do that. social security medicare and other safety-net programs make up about percent of the federal budget according to the nonpartisan center on budget and policy priorities appropriations for cpb nea and neh total less than percent of total federal spending its another matter to consider whether the government should fund public broadcasting cole said adding thats a fair debate to have but dont call it deficit reduction because its not and youre not likely to win that way. trumps first budget proposal for and is expected to be released at the end of february and to summarize the new presidents main priorities for federal spending the full detailed budget is expected by late april cole said its too early to predict how the new administrations budget may affect public broadcasting first we need to finish up the fiscal budget cole said as for public broadcastings appropriation which is forward-funded by two years theres no way we would change the fiscal budget for cpb that fy17 funding approved in is supported by both the senate and house he said as for the fy17-18 budget i wont say that no programs will be cut cole added beyond the gop majoritys priority to reduce federal spending there could be pressure to reallocate funding under his subcommittees jurisdiction to other agencies such as the national institutes of health if congress decides to increase funding to nih then it could become robbing peter to pay paul if nih is the paul who are the peters cole said hes heard nothing definitive about the white house following the heritage budget which also targets many other federal programs but he added that mick mulvaney president trumps nominee for director of the office of management and budget has very close ties to the heritage foundation maybe he gathered some of his ideas from that budget but we cant know for certain. heritage foundation president jim demint a former congressman who submitted several bills to defund cpb released a statement last month saying he was delighted with mulvaneys omb nomination cole meanwhile has been singled out for praise by americas public television stations last year public tvs lobbying group presented its champion of public broadcasting award an honor reserved for key advocates in congress and state capitals to the oklahoma lawmaker in announcing the award apts president patrick butler said coles extraordinary leadership was instrumental in ensuring that the fy house labor-hhs-education appropriations bill included million in level funding for cpb the first time in five years the house has proposed anything but a zero for public broadcasting. apts honored vice president michael pence as a champion in as governor of indiana pence restored state funding to public broadcasting which had been zeroed-out of indianas budget for eight years cole continues to support public broadcasting back home in oklahoma as well he listens to kgou-fm from norman every morning im really pleased to see the station expand into other areas he said a lot of smaller communities like ada and seminole have not historically had service and now do. cole particularly enjoys listening to nprs morning edition with public radio i can wake up without someone shouting at me he noted npr content is informative and fair cole said i know some people disagree but if theyd listen to the content theyd likely come to another opinion. he said npr and pbs both perform a valuable service i support them both. topics news/current events us oklahoma keywords oklahoma ~sigh to drango

skip to comments wheres melania trump first lady raises questions after making no appearances since inauguration world breaking news jan posted on by drewh melania trump has finished her first week as first lady a title that automatically makes her one of the most prominent women in the country and yet she was barely visible she cut an elegant figure at her husbands swearing-in and at the inaugural balls but two days later she returned to new york as she had said she would to tend to her 10-year-old son barron who remains in school there meanwhile she has given little indication of how much she intends to embrace the life of a public figure she is said to be building her staff but she has made no public appearances since a prayer service the morning after the inauguration given no media interviews as first lady and has not indicated with any specificity what she has planned for her new role theres a public expectation for communication and shes not providing it said lauren wright a political scientist and author of on behalf of the president. its interesting that there doesnt seem to be a willingness to shape her public image despite the public interest. by any measure melania trumps east wing has gotten off to an unusually slow start last week came word that the first lady had made her first hire stephanie winston wolkoff a new york party planner who will serve as a senior adviser according to a person with knowledge of the appointment still several key positions on her staff have not yet been filled including chief of staff communications director and press secretary that last job is so essential that a volunteer has stepped in to field calls the volunteer jessica boulanger is a former capitol hill staffer who is now the senior vice president for communications at the business roundtable most striking the trump team has not yet named a social secretary a position responsible for planning all white house events most previous administrations filled the job before inauguration day amid the silence some members of the public are rushing to assumptions internet wits spent days dissecting the first ladys facial expressions and body language during the inauguration painting several interactions with her husband as fraught a moment when he left melania several paces behind him as he met the obamas on the white house steps and another when she appeared to frown behind his back the twitter hashtag freemelania caught fire but all seemed well on the couples official social-media accounts although occasionally reactive to jibes neither responded to the twitter conjecture which came amid a fire hose of larger administration controversies president trumps potus account tweeted a thank you to his family with photo of his wife smiling melania who has not tweeted from her personal account since election day has sent only one message from her new flotus account saying that she is deeply honoured to serve as first lady she entered the white house with the lowest favorability ratings of any modern first lady only percent of the public had a favourable view of her in a gallup poll released jan. while the same percentage gave her an unfavourable rating michelle obama laura bush and hillary clinton each had a favourability rating above percent when she became first lady americans are accustomed to seeing the first family together said myra gutin a communication professor at rider university and author of the presidents partner. and the slovenia-born former models decision to live in new york for now may be compounding any negative perceptions of her she has said she intends to return to washington on weekends to see president trump she could be giving the administration a little bit of a softer touch because we do make certain decisions about a president based on his family gutin said ivanka and her family are there but with mrs. trump and mr. trumps younger son it would be a different kind of feeling. melania trumps quiet first week may signal that she is reluctantly grappling with how to embrace the increased scrutiny or she could simply be taking her time to determine how she will make an impact each first lady takes on the role and makes it their own that evolves over time said former white house social secretary ann stock first priority for every president and first lady is settling in their family. michael dantonio a donald trump biographer said melania seemed eager to preserve her privacy when he met her her husband playfully begged her to tell me he was a great husband and she complied however she fled the room as soon as possible dantonio recalled i expect her to be gracious when acting as first lady but i would not be surprised if she limits herself to a minimal engagement with the role. does it matter that shes taking her time with the job one former white house official noted that staffers who arrive after an administrations early days can have a hard time finding traction within the larger organisation assuming of course that melania trump cares about wielding influence in that space the job is more than ceremonial federal courts have ruled that the first lady is a de facto public official and congress has authorised staffing to support her assistance to the president said maryanne borrelli a professor of government at connecticut college and author of the politics of the presidents wife. in pictures women of the world march against trump show all meanwhile there are years of tradition surrounding the role and melania trump will be measured against the women who came before her whether or not she chooses to play along michelle obama whom melania trump has said she admires was also a reluctant first lady she too worried about raising her children in the spotlight but from the beginning she positioned herself as a vital part of her husbands administration while billing herself as mom-in-chief michelle obama nonetheless had a team building her agenda when she entered the white house in her second week she began a tour of federal agencies thanking the employees for their work other first ladies though have waited months before rolling out their agendas melania trump has so far cited one issue she hopes to champion cyberbullying which is said to affect about a quarter of adolescents experts in the field say they have not yet heard from the first lady but are eager to collaborate everyone is kind of looking around saying who is she going to turn to said justin w. patchin a co-director of the cyberbullying research centre she is a very public figure at the very least she can bring this issue to further light. jane hampton cook a novelist and author of popular histories about the white house said melania trumps reserve could heighten interest in her when she does surface she recalled a short speech the future first lady gave in pennsylvania near the end of the campaign in which she vowed to be an advocate for women and for children. i found myself listening to her more because i hadnt heard from her for a while cook said sometimes less is more and she represents that side of the equation her husband is more more more. topics chit/chat society keywords fakenews melania melaniaarticle to drewh from the way she’s been treated i’d stay out of the limelight too why give

all parties to nuclear deal must comply with commitments iran official iran press tv tue jan 7:14pm the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council has underscored the need for the complete implementation of the landmark nuclear deal between iran and six world powers noting that all signatories must respect their obligations the endurance of the jcpoa joint comprehensive plan of action is contingent upon the commitment of all parties to the fulfillment of their obligations drifting away from this process based on any pretext and approach will lead to a reciprocal measure ali shamkhani said in a tuesday meeting with french foreign minister jean-marc ayrault in tehran shamkhani hailed the boost in tehran-paris diplomatic and economic ties in the post-jcpoa era and stressed the need to expedite the removal of the existing obstacles particularly with regard to banking transactions heading a senior politico-economic delegation the french foreign minister arrived in the iranian capital on monday for a two-day official visit ayrault for his part expressed satisfaction over his meetings with iranian officials and described the prospect of tehran-paris relations in the post-jcpoa era as highly promising he hailed iran 's on-time implementation of its obligations under the nuclear deal and noted that the existing process will guarantee the two countries interests in different political and economic spheres upon his arrival in tehran ayrault told reporters that he had traveled to iran as a defender of the nuclear deal amid concerns that the us may scrap it france was one of the six countries that with european union eu coordination negotiated the deal with iran although france on several occasions adopted a hard line against iran during the course of the negotiations giving the impression that it was putting diplomatic attempts for a deal in jeopardy paris has been a staunch supporter of the agreement since its signing in july under the jcpoa all nuclear-related sanctions on iran were terminated and iran in return agreed to apply certain limits to its nuclear program and provide enhanced access to international monitors to its nuclear facilities but there has been concern recently that the us under president donald trump would violate the deal or stop implementing washington 's commitments under the accord altogether a self-admitted non-politician trump had previously threatened to rip up the deal and called it the worst accord ever and one of the dumbest ones he had come across on saturday french president francois hollande said he had warned trump to respect the historic nuclear deal between iran and the p5+1 group of countries anti-terror campaign also at the meeting shamkhani pointed to the terrorists attacks in france over the past two years which have claimed the lives of several french citizens and underscored the need for an all-out campaign against terrorism adopting double standards in fighting terrorism and dividing terrorism into good and bad leads nowhere but to the spread of the wave of violence and crime he added shamkhani criticized paris for allowing the terrorist mujahedin-e khalq organization mko to be freely active in france despite the group 's terrorist actions against the iranian citizens and officials and its cooperation with the former iraqi dictator saddam hussein during the eight-year iran-iraq war in the 1980s any support for this terrorist group will send non-friendly messages to the islamic republic of iran he noted the terrorist group had to flee iran shortly after the islamic revolution in after carrying out a spate of assassinations and bombings which took the lives of many top officials and civilians the mko is listed as a terrorist organization by much of the international community and has committed numerous terrorist acts against iranians and iraqis political solutions key to syrian crisis elsewhere in his remarks shamkhani elaborated on the ongoing cooperation among iran russia and turkey to set out a political framework to resolve the syrian crisis and noted that the efforts have led to the most successful ceasefire and direct dialogue between damascus and the foreign-backed armed opposition groups over the past six years political solution and dialogue should be considered as the unavoidable strategy to resolve the regional crises and it should replace use of terrorism as a tool to meet political ends he added last week syria 's warring sides held direct talks in astana kazakhstan with the mediation of iran russia and turkey at the end of astana talks on january iran russia and turkey agreed on the establishment of a trilateral mechanism to support the ceasefire in syria and monitor possible violations news letter join the globalsecurity.org mailing list enter your email address Iran Iran Press TV Tue Jan Supreme National Security Council Iran obligations.

amsterdam jta the jews of friesland a region in the northern netherlands are not known for stories with happy endings during the holocaust friesland’s vibrant jewish community was forever obliterated including its endemic customs and distinct yiddish dialect it is one of the starkest examples of how the holocaust decimated and irreparably changed dutch jewry that’s why the recent surfacing of a unique film from showing the wedding of a frisian jewish couple who escaped the genocide is generating remarkable reactions from local media and dutch state historians here over the past week the film is the only known footage of frisian jewish life from before the holocaust its discovery comes amid a wave of popular interest in the holocaust in the netherlands including in films and series with record ratings and in the construction of monuments most recently with the opening last year of the national holocaust museum in amsterdam the silent black-and-white film was the subject of a special aired last week in prime time by the region’s public broadcaster omrop fryslân all the region’s main dailies reported on it as did some national publications including the netherlands’ main television guide placed on youtube by the frisian film archive on jan. it received thousands of hits becoming the archive’s second-most-watched video over the past two years the couple’s children handed it over this month to the frisian film archive after finding it in their late mother’s suitcase in they had hung onto it for nearly a decade to “come to terms with it andre boers one of the couple’s three children told jta on tuesday the seven-minute film posted online last week excerpted from longer footage shows the bride mimi dwinger wearing a form-fitting satin wedding dress and riding a horse-drawn carriage with her fiancé barend boers it’s a sunny spring day and the couple is headed from leeuwarden city hall to the local synagogue as elegantly dressed women and men wearing top hats stream into the synagogue other locals from the jewish quarter of this poor provincial city gather around the entrance for a better view of what seems to be an unusually opulent affair inside the synagogue which seems full to capacity with wedding guests the region’s chief rabbi abraham salomon levisson officiates he’s wearing the black hexagonal hat favored by sephardic rabbis an influence brought to holland by portuguese jews smiling boers signs the ketubah the religious marriage contract the ring is too small for a comfortable fit boers flashes an amused smile at the camera as dwinger quickly licks her finger to make it easier to slip on the jewelry touchingly boers holds up her veil while she does this the newlywed couple appears relaxed at the reception held at the local jewish kosher hotel the german eagle the guests chat and after a few glasses of advocaat dutch eggnog they giggle at the cameraman the excerpt the full footage was given on loan to the archive earlier this month ends with boers gently kissing his wife on the forehead nothing about the film suggests that the people featured in it had any idea their world was coming to an end just a year after filming the people in the movie would come under the nazi occupation that decimated the frisian jewish community along with percent of dutch jews the highest death rate in occupied western europe for example the body of the congregation’s rabbi levisson was found in inside a german cattle car that was full of dead or dying jews when the advancing russian army encountered it in eastern europe the bride’s father moses was arrested and sent to the death camps in fewer than members of his extended family of about survived the war according to andre boers though the jews in the film appear relaxed frisian jews did have an inkling of the storm heading their way according to hans groeneweg a historian at the frisian resistance museum a state-funded institution entrusted with documenting the occupation years “the bride you see smiling in that film she’s a woman running for her life he told the frisian broadcasting authority in a 25-minute round table discussion that aired jan. levisson was especially aware of the danger as he had been helping settle in the netherlands refugees from neighboring nazi germany for years while few of their relatives and guests survived the lovebirds plotted the escape that saw them survive against all odds they escaped the netherlands in through france and spain to jamaica boers enlisted to fight with the allies while his wife volunteered to work for the british war office boers participated in the liberation of the netherlands in as part of a dutch brigade that fought embedded within the canadian army the couple returned to the liberated netherlands boers died in at his widow mimi passed away nine years ago at her three children now live in amsterdam and israel the frisian film archive learned of the film’s existence after the family offered to give the 16mm footage to the archive on loan “for decades we’ve been looking for footage from the jewish community before the war and now here it is syds wiersma an archivist for the frisian film archive told the regional broadcaster last week the film’s appeal according to groeneweg the resistance museum historian isn’t just its rarity “it offers hope hope that not all the people in that film died in the camps that a few managed to escape after all he said but for andre boers mimi and barend’s middle child who is living in israel the film has a far more personal significance before the family found it he had not seen moving images of many of the relatives featured it’s a “highly emotional opportunity to see my grandparents great-grandmother uncles aunties and many others just a few

white house press secretary sean spicer calls on a reporter during the daily briefing at the white house in washington tuesday jan. spicer answered questions about the extreme vetting executive order the upcoming supreme court announcement and other topics ap photo/susan walsh by vivian salama and eileen sullivan the associated press the white house said tuesday that no american citizen will ever be targeted in raids against terror suspects a blanket statement that appeared to signal a break from the obama administration 's strategy for pursuing and targeting suspects in counterterrorism operations overseas under former president barack obama the justice department had issued a legal opinion giving the u.s. the authority to target americans who are working with terrorists abroad white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters the trump administration will lean on the guidance of central intelligence agency director mike pompeo and defense secretary jim mattis but he added that no american citizen will ever be targeted it was not immediately clear whether spicer 's intended to recalibrate u.s. policy the u.s. specifically targeted and killed american anwar al-awlaki a radical cleric in yemen in other americans including suspected terrorists have been killed in u.s. drone strikes but they were not specifically targeted a u.s. service member and an american child died in a ground raid authorized by president donald trump last week the child was the 8-year-old daughter of al-awlaki al-awlaki 's 16-year-old american son was killed in a u.s. drone strike in sunday 's raid left nearly others dead including more than half a dozen militant suspects several more children were also killed whether the u.s. should target its own citizens in drone strikes has been the subject of much debate during the presidential campaign trump discussed going after the families of suspected terrorists but he did not specify what that meant the u.s. has been striking al-qaida in yemen from the air for more than years mostly using drones sunday 's surprise pre-dawn raid could signal a new escalation against extremist groups in the poor but strategically located country last week the trump administration imposed an immigration and travel ban on people from seven countries including yemen citing terrorism concerns obama said in that he did not believe it would be constitutional for the government to target and kill any u.s. citizen with a drone or with a shotgun without due process nor should any president deploy armed drones over u.s soil he added however that if that citizen wages war against america or is actively plotting to kill americans his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd later that same year the obama administration triggered a fiery debate on capitol hill over the limits of its drone program following the death of al-awlaki 's teenage son an american citizen sixteen-year-old abdulrahman al-awlaki an american citizen at the time of the strike that killed him had n't seen his father in two years when he was killed he had no known links to al-qaida and is said to have lived the life of an ordinary teenage boy associated press reporter lolita c. baldor contributed to this story White House Sean Spicer White House Washington, Tuesday, Jan.

portland portland tenants forced to leave their homes and apartments might soon get some help paying to move the city council is set to vote thursday on an ordinance that would require landlords to help pay moving costs for tenants evicted without cause or compelled to move by rent increases of at least percent under the ordinance landlords would pay renters between and depending on the number of bedrooms in the rented homes a majority of city commissioners told the ore­gonian/oregonlive in a story published tuesday that they plan to support the ordinance portland’s newest city commissioner chloe eudaly proposed the tenant-­protection rule after promising during her campaign to fight for renters who have seen their rents soar in recent years if approved the ordinance is expected to face an immediate legal challenge from multi­family nw an association of companies that own or manage apartments said john dilorenzo an attorney and lobbyist who has sued the city at least seven times over the years dilorenzo said eudaly’s office rushed the proposal and never met with landlords to discuss potential unintended consequences he said the ordinance conflicts with state law that bars rent-control measures “i don’t believe any of this has been drafted in a collaborative process at all dilorenzo said eudaly said the ordinance does not infringe on landlords’ rights to raise rents but instead requires landlords to share the financial burden when they cause a displacement “we feel very confident that this is highly defensible in court she said eudaly said her office has spoken with several landlords who expressed support for her plan her staff did not consult dilorenzo or multifamily nw because she does not believe they have offered viable solutions she said “if they’re coming to testify on thursday i’m all ears eudaly said “i’m so excited to hear what their solutions are.” commissioner nick fish called eudaly’s proposal a thoughtful compromise because she advocated rent control during her campaign and easily defeated incumbent steve novick he also encouraged landlords to come up with alternative solutions to city’s housing emergency caused by rapidly rising rents that have increasingly hit working and middle-­class renters hard “if there is a different and better approach i want to hear it fish said “if we have to fight this in court so be it.” the city in approved rules requiring landlords to give tenants days’ notice before issuing no-cause evictions or rent increases of percent or more more oregon articles PORTLAND Portland move.

the new york times has periodically to its shame succumbed to the kind of xenophobic fearmongering that president donald trump is now trying to make american policy in the times sternly warned that too many irish and german immigrants like the trumps could “deprive americans by birth and descent of the small share they yet retain” in new york city in the times cautioned in a front-page article that european jews desperately seeking american visas might be nazi spies in as japanese-americans were being interned the times cheerfully suggested that the detainees were happily undertaking an “adventure.” we make bad decisions when we fear immigrants we “otherize.” that’s why americans burned irish catholics alive banned chinese for decades denied visas to anne frank’s family and interned japanese-americans and yes the new york times sometimes participated in such madness but we will not be part of that today trump signed an executive order on friday that suspends refugee programs and targets muslims from certain countries it’s hypocritical for trump to be today’s avatar of hostility to immigrants since his own family suffered from anti-german sentiment and pretended to be swedish but i’m indignant for a more personal reason and i’m getting to that kirk w. johnson a former american aid official in iraq fears that the executive order will bar military interpreters who have bled for america and to whom we have promised entry he told me about one interpreter nicknamed homeboy who ran through fire to rescue a wounded american soldier and then was himself shot homeboy survived barely but lost his leg and as he recovered a grenade was thrown at his home by insurgents angry that he had helped americans after years of vetting homeboy was approved for a visa for interpreters who helped the united states does trump really want to betray such people who risked more for america than trump himself ever did yet if fear and obliviousness have led us periodically to target refugees there’s also another thread that runs through american history it’s reflected in the welcome received by somebody i deeply admire wladyslaw krzysztofowicz and this is personal raised in what was then romania and is now ukraine krzysztofowicz was jailed by the gestapo for assisting an anti-nazi spy for the west his aunt was murdered in auschwitz for similar spying but he was freed with a bribe when world war ii was ending he fled his home as it fell into the hands of the soviets after imprisonment in a yugoslav concentration camp he made it to italy and then france but he couldn’t get a work permit and he thought that neither he nor any children he might later have would ever be fully accepted in france so he dreamed of traveling to america which he had heard would be open to all he explored a fake marriage to an american woman to get a visa but that fell through finally he met an american woman working in paris who convinced her family back in portland oregon to sponsor him along with their church the first presbyterian church of portland as krzysztofowicz stood on the deck of the ship marseille approaching new york harbor in a white-haired woman from boston chatted with him and quoted the famous lines from the statue of liberty “give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free krzysztofowicz spoke little english and didn’t understand so she wrote them down for him and handed him the paper saying “keep it as a souvenir young man.” then as she was walking away she corrected herself “young american.” krzysztofowicz kept that scrap of paper and marveled that he a refugee who had repeatedly faced death in the old country for not belonging now somehow counted as an american even before he had set foot on american soil even before he had learned english it was an inclusiveness that dazzled him that kindled a love for america that he passed on to his son that strand of hospitality represents the best of this country the church sponsored krzysztofowicz even though he wasn’t a presbyterian even though he was eastern european at a time when the communist bloc posed an existential threat to america he could have been a spy or a terrorist but he wasn’t after arriving in oregon he decided that the name krzysztofowicz was unworkable for americans so he shortened it to kristof he was my dad recently i returned to the first presbyterian church to thank the congregation for taking a risk and sponsoring my father who died in and the church i’m delighted to say is moving to support a refugee family this year mr. president please remember this is a country built by refugees and immigrants your ancestors and mine when we bar them and vilify them we shame our own roots nicholas kristof grew up on a sheep and cherry farm in yamhill kristof a columnist for the new york times since writes op-ed columns that appear twice a week he won the pulitzer prize two times in and New York Times President Donald Trump policy.

updated at p.m et homeland security officials are defending the trump administration 's executive order on immigration and refugees along with its implementation at a news conference tuesday dhs secretary john kelly said the order creates a temporary pause as officials assess the strengths and the weaknesses of our current system he was adamant in saying that the order is not i repeat not a ban on muslims the controversial executive order suspends new-refugee admissions for days and blocks travelers from seven muslim-majority countries iraq iran syria yemen sudan libya and somalia for days syrian refugees are banned indefinitely the trump administration immediately faced legal challenges from advocacy groups that say the order is discriminatory toward muslims an accusation that kelly denied at least one u.s. state washington has filed a lawsuit seeking an emergency stay of the order the executive order issued friday has also garnered criticism for its chaotic and seemingly uneven initial implementation i think it 's fair to acknowledge that communications publicly and interagency have n't been the best in the initial rollout of this process said kevin mcaleenan acting commissioner of u.s. customs and border protection however the officials largely defended the order 's implementation saying they immediately took action to implement provisions one area of confusion has been the status of green card holders or lawful permanent residents from the seven countries mcaleenan says they developed a waiver process over a matter of hours friday night to saturday afternoon under the executive order section there 's a provision for granting waivers when it 's in the national interest so lawful permanent residents are technically covered in the executive order as immigrant visa holders we worked quickly with counsel to devise a waiver process the secretary has given guidance that returning residents their status as an lpr in the u.s. is dispositive that it 's in the national interest to welcome them home so once we got that guidance we were able to delegate the authority to grant a waiver out to the field and were able to clarify with the carriers that these folks were allowed to board in the first hours of the order mcaleenan says lawful permanent residents obtained such waivers in addition to waivers for immigrant visa and nonimmigrant visa holders he adds that travelers with visas from the seven specified countries were not allowed to board now he says green card holders and special immigrant visa holders are able to board flights and will be processed for a waiver upon arrival other travelers from the seven countries wo n't be able to get on u.s.-bound flights and will be referred to the department of state for further process the executive order allows for refugees to be considered for waivers if they were already in transit and if denying entry would cause undue hardship mcaleenan says he adds that refugees will be arriving this week and we 'll be processing them for waivers through the end of the week another source of confusion has been the status of dual nationals mcaleenan says those travelers will be assessed at our border based on the passport they present not any dual national status for example he says a citizen of both the u.k. and one of the listed countries can present a u.k. passport and not be subject to the order kelly denied reports that dhs was caught off guard by the order stating he had been expecting it for the past year and a half to two years because of trump 's comments during his campaign he says he learned probably thursday that the order would be signed the following day and notes that certainly if you really you know if you really want to know what was in the executive order just read the newspaper the day before and you 'd find out people on my staff were generally involved kelly adds trump has called for extreme vetting and kelly sketched out some of the measures he says officials are considering when someone comes in and asks for consideration to get a visa it might be certainly an accounting of what websites they visit it might be telephone contact information so that we can see who they 're talking to but again all of this is under development but those are the kind of things we 're looking at social media we have to be convinced that people that come here there 's a reasonable expectation that we do n't know who they are and what they 're coming here for and what their backgrounds are as for when the travel freezes will be lifted kelly states i would be less than honest if i told you that some of those countries that are currently on the list may not be taken off the list anytime soon Updated p.m. ET Homeland Security Trump administration's refugees, implementation.

martinez monsivais ap obama fights back former president 's orbit resists trump back to gallery washington ap dismayed by the trump administration 's first days former president barack obama 's loyalists former aides and even his spokesman are speaking out and even actively resisting the new american leader it 's a warning to president donald trump that his actions wo n't go unchallenged by those who occupied the white house before him while it does n't appear that anyone is coordinating the flurry of tweets public statements and direct challenges to trump former obama administration officials said they 're taking cues from their longtime boss in his final weeks obama pledged to be an unobtrusive and deferential ex-president but pointedly reserved the right to protest if trump violated what obama considered core american values it took trump barely a week to cross obama 's threshold with an executive order cracking down on refugee admissions and a ban on travel from seven majority-muslim countries obama on a post-presidential vacation in california broke his silence this week through a spokesman obama fundamentally disagrees with religious discrimination the spokesman said obama 's loyalists already were weighing in his u.n. ambassador samantha power tweeted the day trump was inaugurated raise your hand if you 're ready to defend everything we have built together these last years at home and abroad a week later obama 's national security adviser susan rice called trump 's restructuring of the national security council stone cold crazy yet obama who polls showed had left office popular and trusted had appeared more cautious about diluting his influence by quickly second-guessing trump doing so could make it easier for trump to dismiss critiques as predictable partisan nitpicking and becoming the face of trump 's opposition could make it harder for the next generation of democratic leaders to emerge so obama said nothing monday when trump fired his former appointee sally yates who was serving as acting attorney general he also wo n't opine on trump 's announcement of a supreme court nominee former white house aides in touch with obama said following his lead team obama is applying what former aides call a mitt romney-john mccain test to trump if trump 's actions seem like something the former gop presidential nominees might have done obama wo n't criticize actions outside the republican mainstream are fair game dan pfeiffer obama 's senior white house adviser and three other former aides have launched a podcast called pod save america a kind of public group therapy session for despondent obama loyalists their latest episode decried trump 's unconscionable muslim ban and discussed trump 's supreme court deliberations with a former white house lawyer the trump administration says the travel order does n't target muslims and focuses on terrorism-prone countries the perspective we bring is as people who have sat in those offices and understand the seriousness and the decisions that cross the president 's desk and we are deeply concerned about what is happening pfeiffer said in an interview denunciations reached a fever pitch after trump 's order on refugees and travel to the u.s by people from seven muslim-majority countries obama 's former national security spokesman ned price said the trump administration 's claim that it only affected a minority of travelers was absurd and un-american price added nearly every racist xenophobic movement in history could be said target a 'minor portion of a population when trump 's white house claimed obama too temporarily banned iraqi refugees the ex-president 's deputy national security adviser ben rhodes shot back this is a lie obama loyalists said the expressions of opposition are n't part of an organized campaign they reported being energized by a series of group text messages facebook groups and email chains in which some of the thousands of one-time obama staffers are sharing their dismay one notably silent figure former vice president joe biden who has yet to criticize trump since leaving office an aide said biden planned to speak out on matters he cares most about such as foreign policy and women 's issues the aide was n't authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity a few who served in obama 's administration have registered objections formally hundreds of diplomats signed a memo to state department leadership this week criticizing trump 's immigration order defying a white house warning that they should get with the program or resign the move was striking because the diplomatic corps is comprised mostly of career diplomats who serve presidents of both parties it was yates obama 's deputy attorney general who mounted the boldest act of resistance she directed the justice department to stop defending trump 's immigration order in court trump had elevated yates to acting attorney general until his own nominee could be confirmed after her protest trump quickly fired her and called her weak on immigration obama 's own attorney general loretta lynch rushed to yates defense she called the decision to

tom jackson review correspondent tablets laptops and digital learning are increasingly being used to reach students with little or no access to education according to an international report from the itu/unesco broadband commission this is especially crucial in the developing world where unesco says the digitilisation of learning could be a means of accelerating progress towards the sustainable development goals such as ensuring access to primary school for all children this process is already evident in africa which according to unesco has million primary-age children not attending school over half the global total yet the continent is overcoming challenges surrounding lack of internet access and electricity to become a major player in the e-learning space according to a recent report from ambient insights africa is the region globally where e-learning revenues are most likely to increase with south africa the leading market on the continent the university of south africa unisa which teaches through distance learning has over south african and international students enrolled and mobile operators have launched digital learning projects such as vodacom’s “e-school” offering online educational content meeting the demand all over the country companies of all shapes and sizes are tapping into the growth of the digital learning market chris rawlinson founder of south african e-learning company courses says “we are living in a world where two billion more people from mostly emerging markets are about to get online.” “there is little to no chance that we will be able to get teachers and bricks and mortar schools in the number needed to these locations fast enough “a part of the solution will have to be that e-learning will have to start to become a lot more accessible and work a lot better than it currently does.” his start-up has partnerships with brands such as ogilvy and barclays to produce courses allowing students to learn from experts in a particular field each course is designed almost like an interactive book with text images videos and links for further reading slow internet south africa’s approach to e-learning has to adapt to the local conditions such as coping with slow or expensive internet the cape town-based rethink education has a learning app for maths and science presenting content in the form of text videos images and diagrams with users required to interact with this content project manager storme magee says part of its popularity is that it doesn’t need a fast online connection or take up too much space on mobile phones “the app is a web-app rather than a native app this means that it does not require any downloading or updates it also does not use up any phone storage “therefore teens do not have to compromise on their music photos and videos to learn she said there are broader applications of e-learning than simply as a revision tool however south africans are also using such platforms to develop their professional skills re-inventing learning getsmarter is one such company in this space the firm partners with leading universities to make online courses in a variety of subject areas the short tutor-led courses run for weeks with students committing to between seven and hours of study per week in the platform educated over students from countries around the world “we consistently achieve over percent completion rates said chief executive officer sam paddock who attributes this to having more engagement with students than some online courses he says online learning could not only reach otherwise excluded students it could also change how lessons are taught “online courses promise increased access to education they also promise an opportunity to explore and evolve pedagogy the art and science of teaching and learning said mr paddock “in a digital classroom environment everything can be measured in a way that is not feasible in a physical classroom.” more flexibility south africa’s university system has been facing a crisis with institutions closed as students have protested against fee rises and criticised the quality of education available to them e-learning could also have a part to play in higher education hertzy kabeya is managing director of the student hub which is rolling out an online study support platform eraonline for tertiary students this is a web-based application for delivering electronic educational technology courses in universities with interactive features such as the chance for students to connect with each other and with subject experts but mr kabeya believes that to make the most of digital learning schools and higher education institutions will have to be willing to adapt “the government is injecting significant amounts of cash in the sector to boost e-learning and help solve some of these problems he said “to speed up the uptake we need institutions to be a lot more flexible to review their current teaching and learning methods “injecting money and increasing budgets for e-learning can contribute to increase adoption but institutions have to be a lot more flexible less bureaucratic and willing to review traditional methods

u.s. president donald trump speaks on monday jan. before signing an executive order surrounded by small business leaders in the oval office of the white house in washington d.c. washington a proposed white house cybersecurity policy would empower the federal government to take a greater role in protecting the nation’s digital infrastructure much of which is in private hands but a draft copy of an executive order on the issue is also notable observers say because beyond its calls to “decisively shape cyberspace” it diminishes the role of once-key players such as the fbi and makes no mention of protecting election systems nor does it go as far as the republican party platform approved last july which sought to enshrine the right of citizens to “hack back” and take other offensive digital measures the draft executive order declares the internet “a vital national resource assigns the executive branch the role of guarding crucial private and public networks and sets out 60-day and 100-day timetables to determine vulnerabilities identify the nation’s major cyber adversaries and design incentives for private companies to adopt better practices once a security review is done the draft calls on the secretaries of defense and homeland security along with the chief of the national security agency to identify areas where the u.s. government needs to focus to ensure “long-term cyber capability advantage.” “compared to other recent orders this one is fairly tame charley snyder and michael sulmeyer wrote monday on the lawfare blog which focuses on national security law the two authors both associated with the cyber security project at harvard kennedy school’s belfer center for science and international affairs noted with surprise that no role was assigned to the fbi “we are not sure how to explain this as the fbi and law enforcement secured an important role in cybersecurity early in the obama administration the post noted “fbi zealously guards its role in investigating malicious cyber activities and had been given a leading role in obama-era policies.” sulmeyer said in a subsequent telephone interview that he thought the omission of the fbi in the draft was “another case of a slipshod process.” “it’s like the immigration executive order where we hear that the department of homeland security didn’t have a chance to look at the thing until the eleventh hour said sulmeyer a former cyber adviser to the defense department while the obama administration focused on collaboration between the public and private sectors for cybersecurity the trump administration seeks more legal authorities to protect private networks deemed critical to the nation’s economy and security “the federal government has a responsibility to defend america from cyberattacks that could threaten u.s. national interests or cause significant damage to americans’ personal or economic security that responsibility extends to protecting both privately and publicly operated critical networks and infrastructure says the draft executive order first published in the washington post the lack of any mention of how to protect digital election systems also drew some criticism given allegations by u.s. intelligence agencies of russian hacking during last year’s u.s. election what remains unclear is how far the administration will go to protect private financial networks email networks run by google and microsoft and other nongovernmental systems many private internet and communications companies are wary of government oversight of their security partly due to clashes in the past year over privacy issues and federal access to data sulmeyer said last year apple fought a federal court order requiring it to provide the fbi with a “back door” into the iphone used by syed rizwan farook one of two perpetrators of a terrorist attack in late in san bernardino calif. that left civilians dead “at some point they will have to say something about law enforcement access to data the whole encryption apple debate and back doors sulmeyer said “it’s not clear what the administration’s view of privacy really is.” mcclatchy washington bureau visit the mcclatchy washington bureau at www.mcclatchydc.com distributed by tribune content agency llc U.S. President Donald Trump Jan.

photo/josh reynolds file of more news video buy ap photo reprints ap president donald trump was poised tuesday to announce his choice to fill the vacancy on the supreme court one of the most consequential moves of his young administration and a decision with ramifications that could long outlast his time in office the president is to unveil his pick during an p.m. est televised address from the white house two finalists for the high court slot neil gorsuch and thomas hardiman were both summoned to washington ahead of tuesday 's announcement adding a dash of drama to the announcement from the reality television star turned president their travel to washington was confirmed by a white house official who was not authorized to discuss the supreme court pick and insisted on remaining anonymous gorsuch serves on the u.s circuit court of appeals in denver a conservative with a writer 's flair and polished legal pedigree gorsuch would be the youngest supreme court nominee in a quarter-century hardiman a 51-year-old with a conservative track record and working-class background serves alongside trump 's sister on the philadelphia-based 3rd u.s circuit court of appeals both were appointed federal appeals court judges by president george w. bush trump is also said to have considered a third judge william pryor but pryor 's standing appeared to slip in recent days in part because his reputation as a staunch conservative seemed likely to make him a rich target for democratic senators in a confirmation hearing the judges appeared on trump 's list of possible choices that he made public during the campaign and each has met with him to discuss the vacancy that arose when antonin scalia died nearly a year ago trump 's pick will restore a general conservative tilt to the court but is not expected to call into question high-profile rulings on abortion gay marriage and other issues in which the court has been divided in recent years despite gorsuch and hardiman emerges as the most likely picks tuesday trump is well-known for changing his mind just hours before the president 's announcement his final decision was being closely held a level of secrecy out of character for trump advisers and associates who sometimes discuss even private deliberations in the press gorsuch served for two years in bush 's department of justice before the president appointed him to an appeals court seat there he has been known for clear colloquial writing advocacy for court review of government regulations defense of religious freedom and skepticism toward law enforcement he has contended that courts give too much deference to government agencies interpretations of statutes a deference that stems from a supreme court ruling in a case he also sided with two groups that successfully challenged the obama administration 's requirements that employers provide health insurance that includes contraception hardiman has a reputation as a solid conservative on the bench but not an ideological activist he has sided with jails seeking to strip-search inmates arrested for even minor offenses but he joined more liberal-leaning colleagues in doing so in second amendment cases the active federalist society member has supported gun rights dissenting in a case that upheld a new jersey law to strengthen requirements to carry handguns in public the ninth seat on the supreme court has sat empty since scalia died in february president barack obama nominated u.s circuit court judge merrick garland for the vacancy but senate republicans refused to consider the pick saying the seat should be filled only after the november election that gop effort outraged the white house and congressional democrats who have suggested they might seek to block any choice trump makes senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york has said democrats will oppose any nominee outside the mainstream white house spokesman sean spicer said that while democrats may not like the political or philosophical background of the president 's pick the criteria in terms of academia background time on the bench the expertise and criteria meets the intent of both republicans and democrats if democrats decide to filibuster the fate of trump 's nominee could rest in the hands of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell trump has encouraged mcconnell to change the rules of the senate and make it impossible to filibuster a supreme court nominee a change known in the senate as the nuclear option a conservative group already has announced plans to begin airing million worth of ads in support of the nominee in indiana missouri montana and north dakota four states that trump won and in which democrats will be defending their senate seats in follow julie pace at http

shortly after donald trump won the presidency in a historic and unprecedented election day upset over rival hillary clinton many on the left took to the streets in protest the situation escalated when protesting turned to rioting in a number of cities injuring police officers and damaging property a week later green party candidate jill stein announced she was launching a recount but only in the typically blue states of michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin which trump had won clintons campaign team joined in on the effort which resulted in finding more votes for trump in wisconsin despite the recount findings resulting in a bolstering of trumps legitimacy leftist agitators urged electoral college electors to abstain from finalizing the presidents place in the white house on the basis he lost the irrelevant california popular vote they failed and ended up with more electors defecting from clinton than they did for trump then came the accusations of russian interference and although not a single vote was changed democrats ran with the narrative anyway to further delegitimize the process and trumps duly elected status as president fast-forward to the inauguration on jan. and democrats a third of all democrats in the house refused to show up democratic rep. john lewis ga. told nbcs meet the press he didnt believe trump was a legitimate president despite the constitutional process validating him as president of the united states now democrats are holding trumps cabinet nominees hostage some of whom are vital to national security such as the secretary of state and attorney general at this point in president obamas first term he had nearly all of his cabinet and agency nominees confirmed thanks to republican cooperation now because of democrat obstruction trump doesnt even have half adding insult to injury democrats led by senate minority leader charles schumer d-n.y. vowed to filibuster trumps supreme court nominee despite not knowing who the nominee was or anything about their judicial record schumer along with house minority leader nancy pelosi d-calif. took to the steps of the supreme court monday night to oppose the president and rally protesters ignoring the basis of trumps executive order on refugees came from obama administration guidance on countries harboring terrorists former president obama who left the white house for the final time just days ago couldnt help but opine on trumps actions for the sake of our values and muddied the waters about what the executive order actually means citizens exercising their constitutional right to assemble organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when american values are at stake obama spokesman kevin lewis told politico with regard to comparisons to president obamas foreign policy decisions as weve heard before the president fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion. his commentary breaks with longstanding tradition of former presidents staying out of the current presidents business not to mention the executive order doesnt discriminate against individuals based on religion and in fact indiscriminately bars people of all faiths including christians and yazidis under isis genocide from temporarily entering the united states it does discriminate based on geographical location all of this is to say americans will quickly tire of democrat temper tantrums especially when they are based on false accusations of racism bigotry and bogus narratives after all thats why trump won in the first place after losing more than a seats in statehouses governors mansions and congress throughout the past eight years democrats should be focused on rebuilding their party not protesting or making surface-level arguments because they didnt get their way in the presidential election republicans are running the table after years of leftist hyperbole and fearmongering they will continue to do so if this is the path democrats are going to take moving forward pavlich is editor for townhall.com and a fox news contributor Donald Trump Election Day Hillary Clinton protest.

bjp high command wants mehbooba to make ‘clarification’ no official release from assembly secretariat information department ahmed ali fayyaz jammu speaker kavinder gupta’s treatment to chief minister’s speech in assembly in reaction to the bjp mla rajiv jasrotia’s objection to a part of her statement has obviously made mehbooba mufti’s position awkward in the state legislature as well as the government the first casualty on tuesday became a scheduled cabinet meeting which was cancelled even after circulation of the agenda in her key speech on the grants of her departments mehbooba had for the first time during pdp’s coalition with the bjp labelled the votaries of the abrogation of article as “anti-national” according to her it was the “biggest anti-national act” to seek abrogation of article that grants special status to j k in the constitution of india and serves as a link between the state and the centre with elections in some crucial states drawing nearer mehbooba’s remarks are understood to have as a major embarrassment for the bjp since decades bjp has been the key sponsor of the movement for abrogation of article it is also alleged to be behind two writ petitions against the state flag and article 35-a apparently under the instructions of his party high command jasrotia sought expunction of cm’s “anti-national” remarks asserting that the bjp jan sangh leader shyama prasad mookerji and the mla’s own family had struggled and given sacrifices for abrogation of article “how could we all be anti-national jasrotia asked on the floor of the assembly he urged speaker to order deletion of cm’s remarks speaker responded to him favourably and said that if there was anything anti-national in cm’s speech that would be expunged with this speaker stirred a cornets nest as the entire opposition led by national conference mla and acting president and the former chief minister omar abdullah created a ruckus they said it was for the first time that a speaker had expunged a cm’s remarks and it would tantamount to a motion of no-confidence against the cm the house was adjourned by the speaker for three times as the opposition demanded the “official position” of the government it pressed to know whether the cm had exceeded her brief or the speaker was wrong in ordering the expunction on the second occasion speaker said he would check the records and see if there was anything objectionable on the third occasion he claimed that he had not expunged anything from cm’s speech he however added that chief minister herself needed to make her purported statement clear till midnight on tuesday she didn’t even as a barrage of news stories asserted that speaker’s action had triggered a storm in the coalition mediapersons did not receive any clarification or official press release on this development either from assembly secretariat or from department of information of the state government well-placed political sources disclosed to state times that a section of the bjp high command was “pretty unhappy” over mufti’s label of “anti-nationals” on her coalition partners without speaking to ms mufti important bjp leaders at the centre established contact with the state party leaders and asked them to seek a clarification from chief minister they made clear that mufti should withdraw her phrase of “anti-nationals” that had made bjp’s position awkward in several states preparing for assembly elections however mufti according to sources declined to make any statement or clarification pleading that it would erode her credibility and make the already hostile ground harder in the valley “we can’t be seen as making surrender after surrender to the bjp we are already in the eye of a storm and the panchayat and lok sabha by-elections in kashmir are not far away” said a senior bjp leader with no clarification pouring in from department of information the pdp leader claimed to state times that today’s cabinet meeting was cancelled only because of the speaker’s “uncharitable action” and the bjp building a stand for abrogation of article he said that notwithstanding the discomfiture some leaders in both the parties were in favour of playing down today’s developments “we are told that the bjp has barred its vociferous mlas including ravinder raina and rajeev jasrotia from making any statement to the press towards the last moments of tuesday’s mayhem speaker came out with the third statement this time around he claimed that he had not ordered any expunction of cm’s speech “let her make a clarification” speaker said however rather than going to the assembly chief minister who was in her office drove straight to pdp’s jammu office in gandhi nagar to attend a party function the problem for the coalition is that both mufti’s speech as well as speaker’s verbal order over jasrotia’s demand have been recorded on over cameras reports indicate that the opposition would again on wednesday rake up the issue and press hard for pdp’s and bjp’s clarifications BJP Mehbooba Assembly Secretariat, Information Department Ahmed Ali Fayyaz JAMMU: Speaker Kavinder Gupta’s Chief Minister’s Assembly, BJP

singapore field service engineer syed irsyaad is due to head for the united states where his firm is based to undergo training in april but thinks it is better that non-muslim engineers go in his place now mr syed is among the singaporean muslims who have been watching the developments in the us closely where president donald trump last friday signed an executive order banning travellers from seven muslim-majority countries including iran iraq and syria from entering the us for days while the ban does not affect travellers from singapore some singaporeans who live in the us or travel there frequently are seeking assurance and proof of the purpose of their travel from their firms so they would not get held up unnecessarily at immigration noting the uncertainty surrounding the execution of the order mr syed said non-muslim engineers could go in his place without such concerns and he would forgo the trip “for peace of mind of the people at home” “everyone is in limbo for now and doesn’t have any idea what’s going on yet it’s a good time to wait it out for a while he told today ms zakiyah ibrahim a singaporean social-work master’s student in new york city said she had been surprised by how quickly the ban kicked in but was heartened to see how the new york community has reacted her university and student accommodation provider had sent “assuring” emails voicing their disagreement with the ban and vowing to protect the needs of international students but mr trump’s unpredictability has also created anxiety ms zakiyah who studies at columbia university has not personally experienced any negative sentiment because of her religion but she feels that the ban has stirred up negative feelings against muslims “and we can’t say this travel ban will not extend to muslims generally she added uncertainty hovers even for non-muslim singaporeans who hold a us green card which grants permanent residency and those with jobs there ms cheow xinyi who will graduate from her columbia master’s programme this month returned for the chinese new year holidays last month she is due to return to new york today to start her part-time job as a community organiser with a non-governmental organisation she wrote to the ngo last week to request a letter confirming her job “theoretically i don’t need it it’s just to be safe i really hope it wouldn’t come down to that.” singaporean serene chew a green-card holder who has lived in hawaii for nearly four decades said she was caught in the middle she is “disheartened” by the travel ban and has “some fear” because she is not american “with trump you never know what he’s going to do she said while acknowledging that some restrictions may have been “a long time coming” citing the troubles faced by germany over the influx of refugees responding to today’s queries ms camille dawson a spokesperson for the us embassy in singapore said the us government was “committed to facilitating legitimate travel for international visitors while ensuring the security of us borders” “the suspension provided for in the executive order does not include singapore and the us embassy in singapore continues to welcome and encourage singaporeans’ travel and study in the united states she said meanwhile americans in singapore who spoke to today generally disagreed with the ban mr glenn van zutphen owner of media consultancy vanmedia group said the move is not keeping with the spirit of what the us has always stood for he said the trump administration should slow down the pace at which changes are being introduced “it’s clear he wants to show his constituency he can get things done but the government needs to move a bit slower to make sure things are done in proper sequence and with more forethought said mr van zutphen who is in his 50s a retired journalist who wanted to be known only as ms jo said she has “never been so scared” “the us is a country of immigrants and supposedly a safe haven in the world i know of friends in the us who are thinking of other places to live she said SINGAPORE Field Syed Irsyaad, United States — April, now.

london it took a battle in the courts for mps to get their say on brexit but when it finally came it hardly mattered the u.k. parliament’s great brexit debate the opening scene in the process authorizing prime minister theresa may to begin britain’s divorce from the eu began tuesday and was best summed up by the conservative mp julian lewis a 20-year veteran of house of commons debates lewis rose to add his words of wisdom to a long catalog of weighty orations by parliament’s big beasts from both europhile and euroskeptic wings of the house he stood drew breath and proclaimed “in my opinion the people have decided and i am going to vote accordingly.” and with that he sat down the debate was the closest thing to a foregone conclusion that british parliamentary democracy can conjure there was plenty of sound and fury as the fundamental divisions between those who wanted the u.k. to leave the european union and those who did not were played out once again but ultimately as lewis said the people have spoken and it is politically unimaginable for either of the two big parties to be seen not to listen so it signified nothing nevertheless there was an opportunity for ken clarke the former tory chancellor and a veteran of the defeated european cause to make a powerful speech that served to remind may and her ministers of how different things might have been and how wrong things still could go for the old warriors of the euroskeptic cause it was a day of triumph britain’s role in the european union had “restored to us our national self-confidence” and given the country “a political role in the world clarke lamented british trade prospects outside look less than appealing he added “nice men like president trump and president erdoğan are impatient to abandon their normal protectionism and give us access he archly proclaimed “let me not be too cynical no doubt somewhere a hatter is holding a tea party with a dormouse in the teapot.” he was not much gentler on his own party invoking the inflammatory name of conservative right-winger enoch powell who famously attacked government immigration policy with his “rivers of blood” speech in musing that even he would be surprised at how the tories had become so “euroskeptic and rather mildly anti-immigrant” since the eu referendum clarke said he would vote with his “conscience content” against article on the principle that “every mp should vote on an issue of this importance according to their view of the best national interest.” no doubt recalling that in the referendum an estimated mps backed staying in the eu versus who backed leave clarke ended darkly “i hope that the consciences of other members of parliament will remain equally content.” for the old warriors of the euroskeptic cause though it was a day of triumph former cabinet minister john redwood took brexit to arthurian heights as he called on mps to vote for article to restore the “once and future sovereign parliament of the united kingdom.” as he waxed ever more lyrical his fellow tory alberto costa seated next to him rose no fewer than five times to interject narrowly avoiding a swipe from redwood’s gesticulating right arm “mr costa i say to you gently that you should remember the merits of keeping a safe distance speaker john bercow advised helpfully jacob rees-mogg known for his devotion to all things historic reckoned that referendum day june would rank alongside the battles of agincourt and waterloo in “the annals of british history.” the forthcoming negotiations nick clegg predicted will quickly get “nasty and acrimonious.” far more somber in tone was labour’s brexit spokesman keir starmer if the debate revealed anything it was the extraordinary challenge his party has faced in forming a coherent approach to brexit the vast majority of its mps and two-thirds of its voters nationwide backed remain but most of its constituencies as the new statesman pointed out had majorities for leave “we have before us a short and relatively simple bill but for the labour party this is a very difficult bill starmer began prompting hoots of derision from the tory benches difficult indeed the party has already seen two frontbenchers resign rather than follow the party whip and vote for article and on tuesday evening another clive lewis tipped as a future leader said he would not vote for article at the bill’s third reading next week if labour’s amendments are not accepted a position that could cost him his job if corbyn decides to impose another three-line whip in favor of article ahead of next week’s vote labour was not the only party pulled in different directions by the competing claims of principle and the people’s will even the staunchly pro-eu liberal democrats faced what for them is a significant rebellion with two of their nine mps defying leader tim farron by indicating they will abstain on wednesday’s second reading vote rather than vote against article not that as julian lewis so adroitly made clear in the briefest speech of the day any of it matters the government is rightly confident that article will pass comfortably but then as the former lib dem leader nick clegg a former mep grimly foresaw the real task begins the forthcoming negotiations he predicted will quickly get “nasty and acrimonious.” “i have a great sense of foreboding he said to harrumphing from euroskeptics and

skip to comments pope told knights of malta chief to accuse cardinal burke in his resignation letter report lifesite jan bentz posted on by markomalley a vehement backlash following attempts to fight condom distribution has shaken the foundations of the formerly sovereign entity of the order of malta the controversy has resulted in one key casualty fra matthew festing grand master of the sovereign military order of malta smom has surrendered the optics are not good by requesting his submission pope francis has publicly humiliated a catholic knight for upholding moral orthodoxy as the wall street journal put it lifesitenews has also learned that the man at the center of the controversy previously ousted for being responsible for the scandalous contraceptive distribution has been reinstated by the pope with even more authority than he previously had on january smom communicated that fra matthew festing met with pope francis and decided to resign upon the pontiffs request the vatican has since announced the sending of a delegate to govern the order together with the ad interim chief fra ludwig hoffmann von rumerstein von rumerstein will be in place until an extraordinary meeting elects a new grand master as a press release dated january stated festing handed in his resignation after the general council voted in favor save one vote of his decision and thereby ended his eight year governance of the worlds largest chivalric order with his resignation he effectively surrendered in the struggle between the two oldest diplomatic entities in the western world a struggle sparked by the dismissal of albrecht v. boeselager grand chancellor before christmas the resignation of fra matthew promises to pave the way for an investigation of the order and further purging of unwanted elements presumably those who are not in line with the re-instituted boeselager as veteran vatican reporter edward pentin reports the vatican applied very strong and direct pressure on the council while being unsure if the resignation would actually receive a majority but festings head may not be the only one to roll according to edward pentin pope francis received fra matthew festing in a private audience on january in this audience the pope asked the grand master to write up a letter of resignation on the spot in which festing included by request that the grand master had asked for boeselagers dismissal as pushed for by cardinal raymond burke the patronus of the order as patronus burke has no direct authority to govern but serves as the popes ambassador to the sovereign council of the smom will the removal of boeselager be traced back to burke and will the cardinal suffer punishment for his counsel it is curious to observe that boeselager has been given unprecedented powers which are neither in the statutes of the order nor that he had before his dismissal in a letter pope francis announced that he will nominate a special delegate and he reiterated that all acts of fra matthew festing are null and void as a letter by cardinal parolin secretary of state of the vatican already stated francis added that baron von boeselager is considered a member of the sovereign council and from that moment on must be invited to all reunions of the council in a contrary case the reunion would be null. boeselager thus becomes a guarantor of the validity of the council in effect putting the very person who originally defied the grand masters wishes in charge another element is the popes involvement it was by the popes recent exhortation to rid the order of freemasonry in combination with the long-standing condom scandal which boeselager was involved in as grand hospitaller that had led the grand master to ask boeselager to resign before christmas boeselager obstinate in his refusal had to be asked under obedience to leave and this set the stage for an onslaught extraordinaire on the government of the order all of this culminated in that moment wherein the sovereign council voted to accept fra festings resignation as leader of the sovereign vatican the pope has gotten himself mixed up into international diplomatic affairs that can under international law be understood as effectively the annexation of one country by another canon lawyer ed condon wrote the interference of cardinal secretary of state pietro parolin with his letter dated january has been deemed unconstitutional another distressing observation is this if by his request for fra matthews resignation the pope treated festing as a religious rather than a statesman francis as supreme leader of the church and vicar of christ urged festing under religious obedience to do precisely that which festing had asked from v. boeselager with one difference boeselager never stepped down by his own accord despite grounds for morally questionable evidence fra matthew festing on the other hand did indeed have the integrity to follow his superior the pope with the reinstitution of boeselager noncompliance wins the day what remains unresolved and concealed is the mysterious donation of million swiss francs held in a trust accessible to boeselagers faction from a benefactor resident in france as edward pentin reported as well as german cardinal reinhard marxs involvement in the whole ordeal according to information gathered by lifesitenews marx was visiting cardinal pietro parolin along with boeselager during his stay in rome for the c9 meeting before christmas to engage in the discussion with cardinal pietro parolin what is plain to see is that boeselagers reinstitution means triumph for the small group of the german chapter of the order who hold the money whip over the law and statutes of the order as so often in the recent church history of the german-speaking world it remains true that involvement in scandals even as grave as condom-distribution can be swept under the carpet if money is at stake boeselagers term as grand chancellor will come to its natural end in until then he has been given the time stature and means to steer the order his way long gone are the days in which the pope in respectful distance re-affirmed the sovereignty of the order as did benedict xvi only days before his resignation the occasion that brings us together is the ninth centenary of the solemn privilege pie postulatio voluntatis of february by which pope paschal ii placed the newly created hospitaller fraternity of jerusalem dedicated to saint john the baptist under the protection of the church and gave it sovereign status constituting it as an order in church law with the faculty freely to elect its superiors without interference from other lay or religious authorities. topics catholic

dust-up had appeared to me all along to have been an attempt on part of vatican insiders to get back at cardinal burke first get burke 'banished so to speak -to knights hospitaller then whether the next move planned from the onset or possibly not make a slap at burke through attacking knights of malta for having allegedly passed out condoms in areas of africa which had high est incidence of sexually transmitted aids virus it was n't about endorsement of sex outside of marriage so much as it was an effort to help reduce the aids epidemic among people who were very likely to not otherwise stop having sex at all much less restrict that to only 'protected sex and/or sex within bounds of marriage only the recipients were not necessarily 'catholics either -by which i mean as far as i could tell and can recall from prior articles some months ago now when this story first began to break the condom distributions were not being accompanied with or were as part of religious training what really stinks is the knights sub-organization involved had apparently already received correction -had repented of had stopped passing out condoms in aid areas long before knuckleheads from within the vatican sought to make further issue out of this by now seemingly punishing persons for having done what they now are no longer doing whatever vatican numbskulls thought this stuff up if it was as much about silencing burke as anything else they 've really stepped in it this time and all for what because vatican theologians got their own pathetic wittle feewings all hurt for having themselves be criticized as being the 'modernists who were a danger to roman catholicism keep it up bergoglio keep doing what you 're doing .and there will hardly be anyone to come to your aid next time muslim hordes try to storm your castle why ca n't you creeps at the vatican who boast so much about institutional memory who boast of 'thinking in centuries when nobody else does according to you guys fail

cnn house democratic leader nancy pelosi blasted president donald trump 's newly named supreme court nominee neil gorsuch as a very hostile appointment and a very bad decision well outside the mainstream of american legal thought elections have ramifications and here is a living breathing example of it pelosi said tuesday night during a cnn town hall moderated by jake tapper pelosi cited gorsuch 's rulings on health care gun safety and environmental issues to explain her concerns she said senate democrats who only have seats and have not yet determined whether to attempt to block gorsuch 's nomination should apply the strongest scrutiny but pelosi did not say whether democrats should filibuster gorsuch a move some in the party would rather use for a future nominee who could change the court 's balance of power pelosi was speaker from until the gop took the house majority in the wave she is still the most powerful house democrat having staved off a challenge for her leadership post by ohio rep. tim ryan as progressive anger with trump spills over pelosi and other top lawmakers are attempting to channel the resistance into legislative victories out of power and without the same procedural tools that senate democrats have to block trump 's actions house democrats strength comes mostly from uniting in opposition to the gop 'sorry for trump pelosi said she feels sorry for trump because he believes as he told her and other congressional leaders in a recent meeting that to million people voted illegally in the election there 's no evidence to back up that claim when i said 'that 's not true there 's no evidence to support that pelosi said he said 'and i 'm not even counting california you know what it is it 's a predicate for the president to go out and say there 's voter fraud rampant around the country she said and it 's not true pelosi criticized republican lawmakers for moves to restrict access to abortions and told a questioner that lawmakers should increase access to family planning birth control and contraception and not defund planned parenthood abortion immigration when an anti-abortion college student who said her mother chose to give her up for adoption challenged pelosi she responded you said my mother chose my mother chose and we want people to have that opportunity to choose as well pelosi lashed out at trump over his executive order banning travel to the united states from seven majority muslim countries calling it a decoy decoy decoy decoy our president is reckless reckless and his administration is incompetent she said how and why they did this is because they are grand illusionists anytime they have a problem with something they create another problem just watched pelosi on ban statue of liberty is in tears replay more videos must watch pelosi on ban statue of liberty is in tears a texas veterinarian who described struggles with violence among smugglers at the border asked pelosi if she would support trump 's calls for a border wall and to eliminate sanctuary cities a lot of the thinking is we need more technology more manpower some fencing perhaps pelosi said she added with more technology and more manpower i think we have a better result than thinking that mexico is going to pay to billion to build a wall pelosi defended so-called sanctuary cities which do not deport undocumented immigrants arguing that they make the united states safer by bringing those immigrants into full society laura wilkerson who said her son was tied up and slain by an undocumented immigrant pressed pelosi on her support for sanctuary cities with an emotional question pelosi said she prayed for the woman and said her son 's killer should be deported or sent to jail but pelosi also defended law-abiding undocumented immigrants in sanctuary cities the point is that you do not turn law enforcement officers into immigration officers that is really what the point is in sanctuary cities she said 'run for office' pelosi also confronted democrats failings in the campaign she admitted to a steel manufacturer that democrats have fretted internally about how they managed to lose blue-collar workers in the midwest in our caucus we 've had this discussion 'how did they not know we 're there for him she said it 's not about who we are because who we are is to be there for america 's workers and we fight that fight every day pelosi said pelosi told a female college student who had participated in the women 's march in washington but was frustrated it did n't catch trump 's attention to get directly involved in the political process you 've marched for progress now run for office she said run for office we need many more women to run for office House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi President Donald Trump's Supreme Court Neil Gorsuch "a "a Pelosi Tuesday CNN Jake Tapper.

hearings for a district court judgeship in my time spent at ayuda a legal aid clinic here in washington was some of the most valuable time that i spent as a law student and as a lawyer i volunteered at ayuda in the office on a regular basis and i did everything from fingerprinting and interviewing persons of hispanic origin who entered the country without inspection and who were seeking work authorization permits when i got my law degree and my license to practice here in the district of columbia i represented several immigrants who had entered without inspection in fact my first case as a trial lawyer while i was at skadden arps was a pro bono case on behalf of an immigrant from el salvador whose name was ernesto orellana-hercules and i was quite pleased that we were able to gain a victory in immigration court we obtained political asylum for mr. hercules to this day that is still one of the most important cases i have ever handled and perhaps the most important and an experience i will never forget do you trust this guy on upholding trump 's illegal alien enforcement i do n't source confirmation hearings on federal appointments s. hrg pt april to thorvaldr supreme

president donald trump 's recent ban on travelers from certain countries could put a chill on international medical visits to hospitals in chicago and elsewhere rush university warned tuesday patients are coming to the united states generally for the most complex necessary care that they ca n't get at home and delaying that care could ultimately be a matter of life or death said tricia johnson a professor at rush the academic arm of rush university medical center who helps track medical travel data for a national consortium of hospitals and health systems about patients came to the u.s. between july and july for treatment at hospitals and health systems in the u.s. that were tracked by a center at rush that does n't include international patients treated at other u.s. hospitals the top five countries that patients came from included saudi arabia the united arab emirates kuwait qatar and mexico she said those countries are n't part of trump 's recent executive order banning travel from seven predominantly muslim countries representatives of rush lurie children 's hospital and university of chicago medicine said this week they have not so far had any patients caught up in the travel ban still the ban could create fear among citizens of countries other than the seven named in the order johnson said patients from other countries might perceive that there would be risks in them traveling here either to get here or in not being able to travel back home that would make them decide to not come to the united states for medical care she said last year lurie cared for patients from outside the u.s. said spokeswoman julie pesch those patients came from countries but the majority came from kuwait the united arab emirates and saudi arabia that includes patients like alialhadhi ahmad who at months old traveled with his family to lurie from kuwait for treatment of spinal bifida a neurological defect that affects the back bones spinal cord and surrounding nerves he was treated at lurie 's spina bifida center for seven months before returning home he visited lurie again last year where he was fitted with devices to help him walk according to lurie rush university medical center spokesman john pontarelli was n't able tuesday to provide numbers on international patients treated at rush but he said most come from the middle east europe and south america representatives for university of chicago medicine and northwestern medicine were not able to immediately provide information about international patients tuesday trump 's executive order signed friday prohibits citizens of iran iraq libya somalia sudan syria and yemen from entering the u.s. for days it also bans syrian refugees from entering the country indefinitely and bars all refugees for days a drop in international medical travel to the u.s. is n't unprecedented the country saw a significant dip in people traveling to the u.s. for medical treatment after the terrorist attacks of sept. as well johnson said it took years for medical travel to the u.s. to recover fewer international patients might be a problem for hospitals said josef woodman ceo of patients beyond borders a company based in north carolina that publishes and sells guides about international medical travel hospitals will feel it because as their margins shrink they need that out-of-pocket patient that they charge a lot of money to woodman said andy garman a rush professor who helps track the data said if u.s. hospitals lose significant numbers of international patients it wo n't affect them in a big way financially some international patients pay for their treatment out of pocket others have insurance that covers care and still others care is sponsored by their governments johnson said the economic impact is relatively low garman said but the mission impact is pretty significant lschencker chicagotribune.com twitter lschencker President Donald Trump's Chicago elsewhere, Rush University Tuesday.

buy photo railroads of lebanon county by donald l. rhoads jr. and robert a. heilman of the lebanon county historical society is a 196-page pictorial and descriptive history of railroads that once ran around and through lebanon county and the industries and people they served photo fran odyniec for the lebanon daily news buy photo little more than a year ago i somewhat hinted that i am a train freak when i reported on lebanon’s old cornwall railroad in fact a dear friend and i have on occasion traced a few old reading railroad and lehigh and new england lines up in the pennsylvania coal region and the lehigh valley my curiosity of the local railroad scene was stoked back in when i noticed the paved-over grade crossing on west cumberland street just east of the u-haul storage facility and proceeded to pay tribute to the cornwall railroad in this space imagine my amazement when i learned that over time there were scores of railroads real and only on paper that rolled around and through lebanon county i knew about the reading line between reading lebanon and harrisburg but what was the allentown railroad company the cornwall and phoenixville railroad company or for that matter the pinegrove and lebanon railroad i found answers to those questions and many revelations in the 196-page book “railroads of lebanon county by donald l. rhoads jr. and robert a. heilman both of the lebanon county historical society the volume is a dandy compendium of vintage photos timetables stock certificates and descriptions of the railroads and as well as the industries in the county that relied on them for transport not the least of which were the bethlehem steel corporation and the iron ore mines in cornwall among the listings in “railroads of lebanon county rhoads and heilman include railroads large and small as well as the industries and customers they served particular attention is given to the cornwall cornwall and lebanon reading and pennsylvania railroads two railroads whose stock in trade was hauling iron ore between the mines and the union canal wharves and the concentrator in lebanon were the cornwall and lebanon and the cornwall the cornwall and lebanon was the venture of iron magnate and railroad financier robert haversham coleman its first train left lebanon for conewago on oct. making a connection at cornwall with the colebrook valley railroad another of coleman’s enterprises the colebrook line provided the connection with the pennsylvania railroad at conewago three years later the colebrook line officially merged with the cornwall and lebanon creating a railroad miles in length commonly referred to as the “corny the cornwall railroad had its general offices in lebanon and stretched approximately miles from lebanon to mt hope it began life as a project of the coleman family in when the line was completed in the first “train a consist of iron ore cars pulled by mules left cornwall later that year “the kittatinny a wood-burning locomotive replaced the mules both railroads offered passenger service the cornwall between lebanon and mt hope the cornwall and lebanon between lebanon and conewago the cornwall and lebanon had its offices and station at eighth and scull streets in lebanon while the cornwall did not have a station it had trackage rights to the reading’s station in lebanon the cornwall and lebanon ran special outings to mt gretna park and its vast recreational attractions including the conewago hotel and lake as well as transporting troops to and from the mt gretna training grounds of the pennsylvania national guard penryn park was the primary passenger destination for the cornwall both railroads had financial stakes respectively in penryn park and mt gretna the last run on the “corny” took place on oct. the cornwall and lebanon was merged on april into the pennsylvania railroad as its lebanon division the division was abandoned in let’s delve further into “railroads of lebanon county.” what about the allentown railroad company it was to be a railroad between harrisburg and new york via allentown and would have connected with the schuylkill and susquehanna railroad that ran through northern lebanon county however the philadelphia reading obtained controlling interest in both railroads and merged them into its system what about the pinegrove and lebanon railroad proposed in this railroad began at pinegrove proceeded south to jonestown then on to lebanon by the line was completed to union forge lickdale by march of to lebanon in it was purchased by the philadelphia and reading what about the cornwall and phoenixville railroad it was to extend from cornwall to phoenixville with the pinegrove and lebanon feeding into it at either lebanon or cornwall although the line was surveyed and graded it was not completed then there were the “paper railroads” that either never got to or off of drawing boards such as the pennsylvania and new england railroad company the pennsylvania midland railroad company and the pennsylvania poughkeepsie and new england railroad company on paper or real most of those railroads have passed into history but in some instances if you look hard enough aided by rhoads and heilman’s pinpoint guidance you can still find some of their vestiges like the cornwall’s general office building at 16th st. in lebanon the cornwall and lebanon’s ornate station and offices at north eighth street in lebanon the reading’s splendid station at eighth and scull streets in lebanon or the iron truss bridge in cornwall that carried the cornwall and lebanon over the tracks of the “corny.” both the cornwall and lebanon station and the reading station are on the national register of historic places and there is a collection of local railroad items on display in the stoy museum at the lebanon county historical society’s headquarters at cumberland st. “railroads of lebanon county” by donald rhoads jr. and robert a. heilman published by donald

resolution next goes to republican-controlled state senate declaring the united states a nation of immigrants and a refuge for asylum-seekers the democrat-controlled colorado house of representatives on tuesday passed a resolution denouncing president donald trump 's executive order imposing a travel ban on several countries and urging its repeal trump 's executive order signed friday temporarily banned refugees and travelers from seven predominantly muslim countries setting off protests and confusion at airports across the country this weekend as federal officials grappled with how to implement the order trump and many republicans including house speaker paul ryan have defended the order as a sensible step to protect the country from terrorism but it has been widely denounced by democrats and some republicans including colorado sen. cory gardner and rep. mike coffman the resolution was sponsored by two freshmen lawmakers state reps. chris hansen d-denver and dafna michaelson jenet d-commerce city kicking off an hour of emotional testimony on the resolution hansen borrowed a quote from mahatma gandhi power based on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent than the one derived from fear of punishment i think we have a clear example of power being derived from fear in this executive order hansen said rep. paul rosenthal d-denver argued that the order was random and arbitrary noting that the attackers came from countries not included in the ban such as saudi arabia he and several other democrats made the case that the order made the country less safe not more secure advertisement it 's turning our friends into enemies and proving our enemies right about who we are and what our goals are rosenthal said minority leader patrick neville r-castle rock urged his caucus to vote no on the resolution wryly noting that if trump was trying to ban muslims as his critics claim it was a laughable effort because most muslim countries were not on the list he recalled his own experience as an army veteran saying that while he served in iraq my life absolutely depended on my muslim friends and was absolutely threatened by my muslim enemies neville defended the order as a mere pause on travel while national security agencies develop a more thorough vetting process to keep out terrorists and he suggested that colorado lawmakers should spend their time focusing on matters within their authority resolutions are often used to convey messages of support or opposition but do n't hold any legal weight tuesday 's resolution urges trump to rescind the order and if he does n't calls on congress to pass legislation to undo it because it 's a joint resolution from the house it will go to the gop-controlled senate the resolution passed on a voice vote for many the issue was an emotional one several lawmakers related their family histories emphasizing that they were grandchildren or great-grandchildren of immigrants the resolution itself referenced the statue of liberty saying the order ran counter to the nation 's values and most prominent symbols rep. joe salazar d-thornton said history will judge america harshly for the order and he added he hopes it does i hope too that history will say that something else happened salazar said that there were groups of americans who stood up on behalf of refugees Senate Declaring United States Colorado House Representatives Tuesday President Donald Trump's repeal.

sen. chuck schumer d-n.y. center accompanied by sen. debbie stabenow d-mich. second from right leaves a senate democratic caucus organizing meeting on capitol hill in washington wednesday nov. after schumer was elected minority leader for the upcoming 115th congress ap photo/andrew harnik the anti-trump protests moved from the streets to the capitol this week as senate democrats began a series of blocking maneuvers to prevent a vote on president donald trump 's key cabinet appointees it is not clear how long the stalling tactics will work but as it stands the senate has confirmed only five of trump 's cabinet nominees leaving critical agencies operating in low gear with only acting heads in charge on tuesday morning the senate finance committee was scheduled to vote on steve mnuchin 's appointment to head the treasury department as well as rep. tom price 's nomination to be secretary of the department of health and human services hhs there was only one problem not a single democrat showed up to the hearing the pre-planned democratic boycott stopped the nomination process in its tracks the boycott was the second stalling tactic democrats used in the past two days on monday the committee was scheduled to vote on the nominations but democrats invoked the two-hour rule effectively posting the business meeting the arcane two-hour rule requires consent from all senators to allow committees to meet more than two hours after the senate comes into session a similar delay tactic was used in the judiciary committee on monday and then again on tuesday to hold up the nomination of sen. jeff sessions to be attorney general democrats took turns speaking at length at the business meeting on tuesday morning and on into early afternoon until the hour arrived when they could invoke the rule and postpone the sessions vote for another day as it stands the committee leadership is seeking a vote on the attorney general nomination on wednesday but it is possible the vote could be stalled further sessions 's nomination was already controversial but filling the top post at the justice department saw renewed urgency on monday after president trump fired his acting attorney general sally yates yates was sacked for challenging trump 's executive order suspending immigration from seven predominantly muslim nations she refused to enforce the ban and in a letter to the administration called into question whether the executive order was lawful the legality of trump 's travel ban had already been approved by the white house office of legal counsel in the senate health education labor and pension committee republicans were able to sneak in one success over democratic opposition and held a vote on betsy devos to lead the department of education every democrat opposed devos but the full senate will consider her appointment this week ranking democratic senator patty murray of washington accused the majority of rushing through the nomination of the billionaire despite outstanding ethical questions and the nominee 's refusal to divest herself from certain financial investments finally on monday night senate minority leader chuck schumer d-n.y. made a last-ditch attempt to stop rex tillerson 's nomination as secretary of state from moving forward during a cloture vote schumer tried to hold the nomination hostage until the senate had a chance to vote block a vote on a bill that would repeal trump 's executive order on immigration the maneuver was unsuccessful but the democrats remain committed to repealing the trump immigration order and blocking the formation of his government many democrats denied that they were engaged in a broader anti-trump strategy saying they were only opposing cabinet picks that were outside the mainstream or saddled with major ethical issues but to republicans the cumulative effect of their actions was clear during a tuesday press briefing senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r-ky. accused the democrats of intentionally creating chaos and manufacturing issues on a daily basis to drag this process out the stalling tactics exercised in the past two days wo n't work he warned none of this is going to lead to a different outcome sen. orrin hatch r-utah who chairs the finance committee expressed his surprise and disappointment when his democratic colleagues did not even show up on tuesday after already delaying the vote the night before i guess they do n't like anything that donald trump does including appointing qualified people hatch argued the tactics used by the democrats to block trump from putting his government are of historic proportions the senator said this type of stuff is so partisan you have to go back to the civil war to find things like this hatch expects the committee will reach a compromise and clear the two nominees price and mnuchin and he said he intends to schedule another hearing this week while he could technically send the votes straight to the senate floor he indicated that he wants to work with democrats to go through the regular committee process for sen. richard burr r-n.c. the democrats protest is clearly an organized effort it shows an overall strategy on the part of the democrats to try to delay and thwart any of the president 's nominees he said adding i 'm not sure the institution has ever seen a strategy like that if the minority party continues their protest burr anticipates it will backfire and create a toxic environment for both parties moving forward it wo n't work he explained these nominees will eventually get confirmed this means they do a lot of damage in the committee structure internally on the democratic side senators a readying themselves for a showdown with the trump white house addressing reporters on tuesday schumer leveled an attack on the new president during the first week and a half of the trump administration the white house has been untruthful incompetent and at times un-american schumer said he went on to defend his caucus 's obstructionist tactics arguing that advise and consent does n't mean we ram the nominees through sen. chris murphy d-conn. who recently introduced legislation that would effectively overturn trump 's immigration ban was fired up about the momentum he sees growing in the form of public protests and his democratic colleagues the protests and the actions from democrat senators are mirrors of each other he told reporters we are rising to what is truly an exceptional moment he said describing the scope of tuesday 's events from the finance committee boycott to a drag-out fight over the devos nomination understandably we do n't have votes so there so there 's only so much we can do he continued but i am prepared to shatter precedents in order to make it clear that we are not going to stand for what trump is doing and the acquiescence of senate republicans murphy was among the group of democratic senators and congressmen who met outside of the supreme court on monday night to denounce trump 's immigration ban which the lawmakers deemed unconstitutional and antithetical to american values while some democrats are openly formulating an opposition strategy others say their tactics are targeted and not part of an overall effort to undercut the formation of the new trump government we decided to oppose having a hearing because there are a lot of unanswered questions and questions that need further clarification sen. bob casey d-pa. said denying the idea that the mnuchin price boycott was part of a broader strategy sen. sherrod brown d-ohio agreed citing two separate incidents involving the treasury and hhs nominees where they failed to answer questions the committee posed to them they sat there and just lied under oath brown said of the two nominees you guys are all assuming this is delay and tactics and politics he told reporters they lied to the committee this is pretty serious stuff in the case of tom price he was accused of misleading members of the finance committee about receiving a privileged offer to buy biomedical stock at a discount while serving in congress price defended himself in front of thee committee saying that he bought the stock at the same price as everybody else a claim the wall street journal debunked as untrue in the case of mnuchin the ohio dispatch revealed that he used aggressive tactics called robo-signing to speed up home foreclosures which led to profits by his firm one west they lied to the committee about things that affect people 's lives in a direct way brown said pointing to numerous ohioans who were forced out of their homes due to one west 's aggressive foreclosure tactics we 're just saying to hatch bring them back in have them explain what they lied about have them give us the whole information the idea of calling another round of hearings for trump 's nominees is totally off the table according to hatch who said democrats have had every opportunity to question the nominees they know how the committee works hatch railed that 's really pathetic that they would even try something like that that 's a pathetic stunt with the trump cabinet appointments on hold republicans are growing anxious about the fundamental ability of the new government to function it is crippling the country not to have these people in place hatch said sen. johnny isakson of georgia explained that the minority party 's stalling tactics can t last for long but they can certainly disrupt the government i think the american people will rise up against it if the democrats continue to block everything because basically the country shuts down isakson said you 've got important decisions that need to be made and they ca n't be made Sen.

african leaders preach unity in readmitting morocco into au voa wednesday 1st february egypt 's assistant foreign minister for african affairs mohamed edrees told voa the move is about strengthening the continent as a whole and stressing common interests to find a way through the impasse the general conviction within the union and this was egypt 's position as well is that at the end we have to have the african house together he said so it is important to find a way forward not a divisive way forward but to move forward on our common african interest common african spirit so that we like many other sister african countries welcome the comeback of morocco and we look forward that this comeback will be a step forward to find a smooth navigation on these problematic issues which have been lingering for quite some time western sahara opposed western sahara 's delegation disagrees and accuses morocco of colonizing the large seaside territory ambassador-at-large sidi omar says allowing morocco to enter without settling the western sahara dispute violates the au 's strong stance against colonialism the delegation wants a clear commitment from morocco that it will abandon its claim to the territory he says western sahara wo n't leave the au though he says the au decision has wider consequences it does not only concern western sahara or the sahara republic it does concern africa as a whole he said if this principle of borders is not respected africa will be doomed to chaos and back to ages which were rife fraught with conflicts delegates and diplomats told voa on the summit sidelines that there may be something to the idea that africa needs to stick together a number of summit delegates publicly and more forcefully privately aired concerns about recent sudden changes in u.s. policies not just on immigration but also on foreign relations and climate change kenya 's cabinet secretary for environment judi wakhungu told voa the au conversations about sticking to the paris agreement on climate change were overshadowed by the u.s. administration 's recent indication that it would pull out of the deal she then praised china for adhering to its climate change commitments it affects all of us she said after emerging from a meeting with about a dozen african heads of state the largest committers of course are the united states and china those are the largest committers so we 're seeing on the one hand that china is trying to reduce its carbon footprint that china is committing to its national determined contribution showing leadership in solar energy commitments for example but then on the other hand we are then seeing pronunciations that the new u.s. administration is going to actually roll back on the commitments that have been made as i said it 's only january and we hope that reason will prevail because we 're all in the same boat Preach Unity Readmitting Morocco AU VOA Wednesday February, Mohamed Edrees, VOA impasse.

afenifere the pan yoruba socio-political group on tuesday gave president muhammadu buhari nine-day ultimatum within which to forward the name of the acting chief justice of nigeria justice nkanu onnoghen to the senate for approval lamenting also what they called the frightening state of the nation saying only restructuring can save the situation the group in a meeting held in the house of the leader pa reuben fasoranti in akure the ondo state capital yesterday which was made up of leaders in the south west deliberated on current issues bothering the country and concluded that only restructuring of the country will solve the escalating problems the meeting which had top yoruba leaders in attendance stressed the need to close ranks beyond political and religious leanings to forge a common campaign against the trend of running the country on a unitary system the meeting which first went into a closed doors after which it engaged its members in an open brainstorming session before issuing a community lasted for hours the leader of the group in his welcome address lamented the state of the nation as evident in the mass killing going in southern and middle belt communities especially in southern kaduna as well in the south east communities and in oke ogun in the south west he also lamented the mass misery that has enveloped the land evident in hunger homelessness and untold hardship on the people of nigeria afenifere also knocked the president muhammadu buhari for refusing to forward the recommendations of the national judicial council for the confirmation of walter onnoghen as chief justice of nigeria it noted that the refusal to confirm him as the substantive cjn was an affront on the nigerian constitution reading the communique after the meeting the publicity secretary of the afenifere yinka odumakin said the meeting was elated that the yorubas had closed ranks as witnessed in the historic gathering which represented a new beginning for the yoruba nation “at this time all its nobles should put aside partisan politics and come together to remake yoruba land and redirect the affairs of nigeria the way the yorubas did in years before independence when we walked with our friends across nigeria to work a federal constitution upon which we gained our independence he said he expressed the worries of afenifere over the situation of the country saying it had become frightening and worrying “the meeting observed that the state of nigeria at the moment is very frightening and worrying with uncertainty looming in the air the communiqué read “we are worried by the mass killings going on in southern kaduna in oke-ogun and in the south east and the state appears to be helpless and sometimes unwilling to curb the excesses of these killers as evident in the governor announcing to the whole country that he paid those who killed citizens and up till date he has not been asked any questions officially “meeting is worried that the nigeria today lies prostrate in intensive care of sick countries because we have refused to run nigeria as a multi ethnic state along federal lines “in in his book thoughts on nigerian constitution the sage obafemi awolowo warned this country that any attempt to run this country on a unitary constitution will be productive of disunity of fighting and the administrative machinery of governance will come to a halt and democratic distortions that is where this country is today that is what awolowo said as far back as but nigeria did not listen to him “to this end meeting resolved to set up a high powered committee to rouse the yoruba nation and to network with our friends and like minds across nigeria the work on the urgency of now to insist that this country must be restructured before we go for another elections in this country we can not afford to continue to slide dangerously along path of anarchy and disintegration.” mr. odumakin noted that the main focus of the of the committee is to get all hands on deck to mobilise for the implementation of the recommendations of the national conference which was submitted to the federal executive council in the year adding that it was the minimum for the restructuring of nigeria on the chief justice of nigeria the communique further read “afenifere is worried that almost few days to the end of the three months tenure in acting capacity allowed by our constitution the president has refused to forward the recommendations of the njc in respect of justice onnoghen to the national assembly for confirmation “we see this as an assault on the constitution if the three months tenure expires and he is not confirmed as the cjn of nigeria “it is an attempt to cruelly end the career of a worthy nigeria therefore we call on the president to within the few days left to the expiration of the tenure of the acting cjn to send his name to the senate for confirmation as nigeria’s cjn.” afenifere also commended olusegun mimiko governor of ondo state for rekindling the developmental strides enunciated by late obafemi awolowo “we commend the giant stride he has taken and we urge the incoming governor mr. rotimi akeredolu san to ensure that he builds on his legacy and take ondo state to the next level the group said those in attendance include ayo adebanjo olusegun mimiko mojisola akinfewa bode george olu falae iyiola omisore olugbenga kaka

editor 's note in the world of cyber law privacy and cybersecurity one of the largest and most colorful figures is stewart baker whose resume includes a stint as general counsel at the national security agency and assistant secretary of homeland security a partner at steptoe johnson llp where he hosts a popular cyberlaw podcast he recently sat down to talk all things cyber with nc privacy blog q thank you for your time so let’s begin with the obvious what prompted you to leave beautiful southern california for a lifetime in the district of columbia in my case it was rather simple my wife refused to live in southern california so i clerked in portland maine and then washington d.c. then my wife and i compromised we stayed in d.c. but far enough out in the country that she could ride horses fuss over dogs and generally look after any four legged creature that came to her q how does one go about becoming general counsel of the nsa you know the nsa was not as high profile in the early 90s so the general counsel position did not have the same cachet it would today what happened was that there was a sense that the legal selection process was not generating candidates that the leadership felt would serve the needs of the agency so a former nsa general counsel was asked to go out and identify some additional candidates at the time she was working with the office of the legal advisor at the state department she called one of my partners a former legal advisor himself that call set the ball rolling q so at that time you weren’t an expert on cyber or privacy issues no i was an appellate and regulatory lawyer this opportunity just happened to be bouncing around and eventually landed on my desk q and on such whims of fate careers turn pretty much q and since then you have shuttled between public service at private practice yes i hold the record for the number of times i’ve returned to steptoe johnson times q times well there was the nsa and then stints at the department of education homeland security and the commission on the intelligence capabilities of the united states regarding weapons of mass destruction q so if you weren’t to the computer born what was your first experience with computers my apple ii e. i bought it used spoke to friends decided a computer that worked was all that i needed i like being cheap q and what was the first legal issue you encountered involving computers law school no not law school i was a law clerk ed justice stevens and the supreme court had just introduced word processing software wang it involved special paper dot matrix printers that shook the floor when coughing out printouts very elegant they ended up building a box around it to dampen the racket in fact i made history by being the first law clerk to lose a draft opinion to the printer we never did find out what happened to it probably still sitting in a queue somewhere q and that’s lost to history unless it turns up in the collection of justice stevens’ papers a few decades from now q so what was it like at the nsa well i was getting my bearings it had been a couple of weeks and then this official came to see me you know one of the men in black and the first thing he did was put a bottle of aspirin on my desk i told him “what’s this i don’t have a headache q what did he say he assured me that by the time he was finished i would have one q what was the issue well it was a forerunner of the encryption debate we have been dealing with ever since it’s been a persistent issue pretty much ever since because there’s equities on both sides of the issue it’s what i call the “first crypto-war.” q was that the controversy over the clipper chip that’s what it became yes the idea was that encrypted communication equipment would have an access key that could be used for law enforcement or national security the access key would be kept in escrow the government could obtain the key by going to court or following a procedure that protected the rights of citizens but still let us fight spies criminals who might be using encryption q what was the outcome the clipper chip itself was a commercial flop since it was carrying a lot of political baggage plus it was really expensive and everyone you communicated with had to buy one even now no one is making much money trying to sell voice encryption devices so we shouldn’t have been surprised the chip probably did drag out the debate over encryption export controls by several years q how did the clipper chip and the crypto war get its start i had just become gc of nsa toward the end of the george h.w bush administration they were not really interested in picking a fight over encryption they had taken a lot of fire from the press they had a packed agenda and they did not see this complex issue as a priority given their time and other constraints then we transitioned to clinton the clinton folks were a lot more interested in it part of it was the life-cycle of the administration it was early they had just come in they had the drive and confidence that they could solve the policy puzzle created by encryption q so you stayed on with the clinton administration and saw both approaches i bridged the two yes it was a real contrast it was like walking into the situation room in the bush administration with a big box of old nasty auto parts covered in dirt and grease you tell the officials we have to making a functional machine from this the first reaction from the outgoing bush folks was to ask “what could go wrong and who will take the blame when it does forward six months later bring the same box of greasy parts into the situation room in the clinton administration the reaction around the table is very different “hey we can fix this.” before you know it everyone’s pulling parts out of the box and trying to put them together q and now when you look back at the crypto wars looking back i feel pretty comfortable that we raised all the right questions serious questions look silicon valley has taken the view that there’s “nothing to discuss when it comes to encryption and that by asking for government access for law enforcement the government is somehow defying mathematics q well the concern as i understand it is this if you build a backdoor for the “good guys” then that is a vulnerability that the “bad guys” can also exploit that argument is not unserious there is a valid point there but the government has a better argument than silicon valley wants to admit look at the apple fight q you’re referring the fbi wanting access to the san bernardino phone yes the fbi went to apple and wanted access to the shooters’ phone and apple said there was no way to get into the phone but the fact is that apple can get into any phone they can get into your iphone or mine that’s how they update software if apple believed the argument it’s been making against the fbi apple would say “the ability to update software is dangerous it creates a security vulnerability it is so dangerous that we should have no updates.” that’s not what apple says instead if challenged on updates apple would say “we have weighed the risks of software updates against the risk of leaving software unpatched and the payoff from updates justifies the marginal risk of compromising your data the same is true for law enforcement access yes it creates a theoretical vulnerability but it also brings really important social benefits in the form of criminals who can be caught q so you’re saying the encryption debate is standard policy analysis determining whether the benefits warrants the risk yes it is like any public policy issue if there weren’t good arguments on each side it would have been settled long ago it’s intractable precisely because each side has a point q so that’s why we are still debating this two decades later because each side as a point that is one reason the privacy argument is not an unserious one but there’s also what i call silicon valley’s “technological arrogance.” the idea that people who disagree with them are just stupid and that they can make policy debates irrelevant by releasing products that resolve the debate in their favor look i’m the first to admit it these are hard problems but the solution isn’t as clear as silicon valley or the privacy groups want you to think q if there was one popular prevailing misconception you could clear up what would it be look movies paint a picture that is so disconnected from reality that i’m not sure where to begin to point out everything that’s wrong when hollywood decides who to make the villain it’s increasingly constrained by lefty politics and chinese money american intelligence agencies have become the villains by default there’s no one else left except perhaps a few balkan warlords q i will have to quote you on that go ahead i wish ordinary americans understood that everything the nsa does is within the law and how much effort goes into ensuring that q training legal vetting and so on yes here’s an example so in the early days of the clinton administration the attorney general of the united states came out to fort meade and frankly she had a bit of a chip on her shoulder with regard to the nsa she gave the impression that she would have explain to us about the constitution i suspected she’d seen too many hollywood movies about us q what happened well the director gave her a briefing of the agency mission then he took her for a tour so here you have the director and the attorney general walking around operations rooms filled with soldiers with earphones gathering intelligence through intercepts and do you know what the director does q what well he stops by a random soldier and taps him on the shoulder q the soldier’s reaction there’s the director and the attorney general so he whips off his headphones and snaps to attention and the director says “sergeant so-and-so could you please tell the attorney general what would happen if you came across an american in your intercepts and the sergeant says “ma’am if we suspect it’s an american this is the procedure to verify that if we know it’s an american we flag it we anonymize it and we start following so-and-so protocol to ensure that we protect american citizens.” and he starts reciting the steps that he takes q steps well there is legal guidance on different scenarios the general counsel’s office has determined what to do in this situation or that situation now that doesn’t mean that that an american’s communications don’t end up in some collection effort that can happen for that matter if there’s an american who is a spy or terrorist or a foreign intelligence operative then they aren’t going to be ignored but every single thing that is done is done in accordance with the letter of the law a lot of effort goes into making sure that all nsa operations are legal q what was the attorney general’s reaction well she learnt the truth that nsa folks know the law they are trained what that law is and everyone without question is expected to follow the law q what was your reaction while all of this was going on you know that lawyers are trained to never ask a question unless you know the answer and here is the director asking a random soldier standing at attention such a question and in front of the attorney general so i ask him later what if the soldier had flubbed it and the director says “i knew he would give the right answer you know why because i went through that training too earlier in my career.” this is the director of the nsa we are talking about and he says he had it drilled it over and over till he could comply with it in his sleep that’s a fundamental part of nsa’s culture q so the snowden revelations the problem with the revelations was that the details of what the nsa does and how much the nsa does astounded a lot of people now i think they were released in a way to have a particular political impact the washington post ran a series of stories that created an erroneous early impression that the agency never recovered from everything the nsa did had been blessed by judges and checked by the lawyers you can disagree with the judges you can change the law but no one should think that the agency was acting outside the legal rules as they stood at the time q have you ever met glenn greenwald or snowden nope we’ve had one or two err intense exchanges on social media but i’ve never met them q what does the grugq reclusive security researcher recently on stewart’s podcast look like i don’t know *laughs* he called in to the podcast i think he used a burner phone and probably discarded it after the call q you have been an outspoken advocate of the position that european privacy regulations first safe harbor now privacy shield and soon the gdpr are thinly disguised protectionist efforts against successful u.s. technology giants yes decades ago french officials were taking the position that data processing industries were “vital national capabilities” that had to be protected now that doesn’t mean that there aren’t policymakers who are genuinely concerned about privacy as a value it just happens that those values tend to come into play at convenient times i think privacy laws are uniquely susceptible to misuse for other purposes q for example if you look at the united states our own privacy jurisprudence came from justice brandeis he wrote strongly on the subject convinced dozens of jurisdictions to adopt privacy laws do you happen to know what invasion of privacy moved him so deeply q i’d hesitate to guess having his picture taken the idea that anyone could take your photograph on the street or in a public place without your permission or consent was simply outrageous to him keep in mind that he came from a background where a portrait typically meant commissioning a painter and then sitting and frankly if you didn’t like it who hasn’t asked themselves “do i really look like that” if you didn’t like it you could burn it and refuse to pay the artist brandeis was so disturbed by the change that he found a right to privacy in united states law there had to be one he thought now we’ve still got remnants of his privacy nostalgia law but it does nothing for the privacy of ordinary people it’s mainly used to enrich celebrities who want to monetize their rejection of privacy and embrace of publicity q so you’re saying privacy legislation is based on old views of technology privacy legislation is almost always an exercise in nostalgia it’s always late it’s always a step behind and it’s an attempt to recapture a world that has slipped away here’s another example by the time the anti-wiretap act was enacted it was already outmoded technology was already making it easy to record conversations and trying to prevent that was an uphill battle now of course with cell phone cameras any time something happens on the street we’ve got three separate feeds law or no law q has this law been abused by the powerful too yes many of the arrests for violating the law against eavesdropping on conversations have actually been efforts to protect police officers in many states until the laws were overturned you couldn’t record a police officer going about his business that makes it harder to monitor police behavior but it has nothing to do with most people’s expectation of privacy q but now it’s a major issue in the european union could privacy issues undermine the u.s. technological edge is data localization a danger i don’t think so say you’re a german you absolutely insist on a german cloud provider you can find one but there will be a cost premium for that and they won’t be able to offer the same flexibility scale features and robustness that say amazon or microsoft can now if you’re the same german and you want a server located in germany amazon and microsoft can handle that for you if you’re concerned about privacy or regulatory concerns handle it at the front end put it in the terms of service q have the privacy regulations dented the american competitive edge in technology no in fact american cloud providers have outpaced international competitors since the snowden revelations they’re winning the race despite european efforts to handicap them with special legal burdens q can silicon valley handle it or is there a role for the united states in dealing with eu regulators the united states needs to push back as a government companies don’t want to be responsible for national security and economic growth that doesn’t mean they won’t do the right thing they are american and but this isn’t really their fight that’s especially true now with the gdpr which creates staggering penalties billions for a single infraction that’s raised the stakes enormously if you’re a u.s. tech provider the path of least resistance is keep the european regulators as happy as you can no matter what the consequences are for u.s. national security q have the hacks of the past summer general powell condoleeza rice affected perceptions of privacy no matter where you stand politically people you respect got hacked podesta powell rice people who laughed when republican emails were hacked were outraged about podesta people are responding in two ways first they are worrying more about security they won’t archive they’ll arrange to delete everything on a day cycle things like that but they’re also adjusting their assumptions about privacy they are being more circumspect in email in fact that struck me about the podesta emails for all the hoopla he was pretty cautious in what he wrote people know that email isn’t private and they’ll adjust their behavior q what are the two big developments you see in cyberlaw in the next months or so well gdpr is a big one i just don’t see a scenario where it sails smoothly into law for two decades now the united states has made unending concessions to europe on privacy issues but european negotiators are never satisfied they keep selling us the same mule the trump administration feels strongly about trade they could easily say “we’ve given enough and got nothing in return no more.” so we could see a confrontation there the other issue is the trump administration’s cyber security policy they have said that they want the department of defense to take the lead but they have not been clear what defense is going to do they’ve specified the driver but not what he’s going to do once he’s behind the wheel my suspicion is that you’ll see greater emphasis on deterring china north korea and iran less attention may be paid to russia but we will have to see q thank you for your time my pleasure In cybersecurity, Stewart Baker, General Counsel National Security Agency

washington president donald trump’s federal hiring freeze is “striking at the heart” of the military’s ability to maintain its equipment the top democrat on the house armed services committee said tuesday rep. adam smith d-wash. said hundreds of defense department civilian maintainers who have been hired for renewable terms at facilities around the country to work on aircraft ships and ground combat vehicles now face layoffs under the freeze which was ordered by trump last week the loss of manpower from trump’s order will hit the military’s maintenance and readiness just as the president embarks on an effort to rebuild the armed forces smith said overall the order could affect thousands of dod civilians hired to do maintenance work for limited terms “this boneheaded ideological attack on the functioning of our government is having real consequences he said the republican chairman of the armed services committee rep. mac thornberry r-texas was working tuesday with defense secretary jim mattis to determine whether the department would allow exemptions for hiring those positions a spokesman told stars and stripes among his first acts trump signed a memorandum temporary halting federal hiring for days with an exemption for military personnel until his administration can create a plan to reduce the size of the workforce he traveled to the pentagon days later to sign another memorandum setting a policy to rebuild the military and calling for a top-to-bottom review “in the same week that president trump says he is rebuilding the military he signs an order striking at the heart of u.s. military readiness smith said in a statement “that is unconscionable and it directly affects the support we provide to u.s. servicemembers in the field not to mention the national security of the united states.” smith’s office released a list of some facilities where the term and temporary dod civilians face layoffs or empty positions can not be filled red river army depot near texarkana texas which maintains humvees and bradley fighting vehicles is set to lay off direct labor and indirect labor employees warner robins air logistics complex at robins air force base georgia works on f-15 jets and other aircraft and it is short aircraft maintainers out of its employees but will not be able to hire anniston army depot in alabama which builds and repairs ground combat vehicles needs to hire workers and are set to be laid off the positions are comprised of term and temporary dod civilians term workers can be hired for to years to handle projects or help with a large workload and temporary workers are hired for jobs that are not expected to last more than a year according to the code of federal regulations under trump’s executive action the defense department and all federal agencies can not to hire new employees or create new positions they are specifically barred from tapping contractors to complete work the move was meant to protect the american taxpayer and halt runaway growth of the government according to white house press secretary sean spicer the freeze will remain in place for three months while the office of management and budget creates a “long-term plan to reduce the size of the federal government’s workforce through attrition.” however the president has allowed mattis and other agency heads to make exemptions for positions they deem necessary for national security and public safety the defense department has not issued any exemptions to the civilian hiring freeze pentagon spokesman johnny michael said it is considering positions that may need to be exempted for several reasons but it has not made any final determinations he did not specify which positions the department is considering thornberry is working with mattis on ways to ensure that the military’s readiness to defend the country and fight wars is not affected according to spokesman claude chafin “no one takes the issue of restoring military readiness more seriously than chairman thornberry chafin wrote in an email last week the acting director at the department of veterans affairs announced he will exempt doctors and other front-line health care providers after a groundswell of concern over the freeze’s effects on its nationwide system of hospitals and clinics stars and stripes reporter corey dickstein contributed to this story tritten.travis stripes.com twitter travis_tritten WASHINGTON President Donald Trump’s heart” Democrat House Armed Services Committee Tuesday.

follow cbsmiami.com facebook twitter tampa cbsmiami/ap the u.s. military’s high-stakes operation to counter extremists’ propaganda might not be going as planned a critical national security program known as “webops” is part of a vast psychological operation that the pentagon says is effectively countering an enemy that has used the internet as a devastating tool of propaganda web crawlers at macdill air force base scour social media for potential recruits to the islamic state group and then language specialists employ fictitious identities and try to sway the targets from joining is ranks but an associated press investigation found the management behind webops is so beset with incompetence cronyism and flawed data that multiple people with direct knowledge of the program say it’s having little impact several current and former webops employees cited multiple examples of civilian arabic specialists who have little experience in counter-propaganda can not speak arabic fluently and have so little understanding of islam they are no match for the islamic state online recruiters it’s hard to establish rapport with a potential terror recruit when as one former worker told the ap translators repeatedly mix up the arabic words for “salad” and “authority.” that’s led to open ridicule on social media about references to the “palestinian salad.” four current or former workers told the ap that they had personally witnessed webops data being manipulated to create the appearance of success and that they had discussed the problem with many other employees who had seen the same yet the companies carrying out the program for the military’s central command in tampa have dodged attempts to implement independent oversight and assessment of the data central command spokesman andy stephens declined repeated requests for information about webops and other counter-propaganda programs which were launched under the obama administration and he did not respond to detailed questions the ap sent on jan. the ap investigation is based on defense department and contractor documents emails photographs and interviews with more than a dozen people closely involved with webops as well as interviews with nearly two dozen contractors the webops workers requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the work and because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly the information operations division that runs webops is the command’s epicenter for firing back at the islamic state’s online propaganda machine using the internet to sway public opinion in a swath of the globe that stretches from central asia to the horn of africa early last year the government opened the bidding on a new counter-propaganda contract separate from webops— that is worth as much as million months after the ap started reporting about the bidding process the naval criminal investigative service told the ap that it had launched an investigation ncis spokesman ed buice said the service is investigating a whistleblower’s “allegations of corruption” stemming from how the contract was awarded the whistleblower’s complaint alleges multiple conflicts of interest that include division officers being treated to lavish dinners paid for by a contractor the complaint also alleges routine drinking at the office where classified work is conducted the drinking was confirmed by multiple contractors who spoke to ap and described a frat house atmosphere where happy hour started at p.m. one of the most damning accusations leveled by the whistleblower is against army col. victor garcia who led the information operations division until july when he moved to a new assignment at special operations command also in tampa the whistleblower contended that garcia successfully steered the contract to a team of vendors that included a close friend’s firm the whistleblower requested anonymity for fear of professional retribution the ap obtained a screen-grab from a facebook page that shows garcia and the friend at a tiki bar in key largo two weeks before the winning team was officially announced sept. the photo was also turned over to ncis investigators by the whistleblower who said the photo created a “clear impression and perception of impropriety.” garcia a west point graduate and decorated officer denied any wrongdoing and described the complaint as “character assassination.” garcia who moved to his new post two months before the contract was decided said he scrupulously avoided any discussions about the contract with both his friend and his former deputy his former deputy served on the five-member panel that reviewed all of the bids “because i was aware of these conflicts of interest i intentionally kept myself out of that process with any of these contract processes garcia said the whistleblower is a senior manager at a company that lost its bid for the work he told ap that he was investigated for attempting to accept kickbacks on an unrelated government contract he denied the allegations which were made four years ago and no charges have been filed in the case the problems with the webops operation and the personal bonds underpinning the new contract illustrate challenges awaiting president donald trump he has promised to boost military spending by tens of billions of dollars while also cutting waste at the defense department and ensuring that contractors aren’t getting sweetheart deals charles tiefer a professor at the university of baltimore’s law school and a government contracting expert reviewed ap’s findings and called central command’s lack of rigorous oversight inexcusable “these people should not be wasting the money consigned to defend us against terrorism said tiefer who served on a bipartisan commission on wartime contracting the commission reported in that at least billion was lost to waste and fraud in iraq and afghanistan “do you speak arabic in a large office room filled with cubicles at central command about people many of them arabic language specialists are assigned to fight is militants on their own turf the internet the webops contract is run by colsa corp. based in huntsville alabama a major challenge for colsa and contractors working on other national security programs— is finding people who can speak arabic fluently and can also get security clearances to handle classified material the problem according to six current and former colsa employees is that to engage with operatives of the islamic state or their potential recruits you need to be fluent in language nuance and islam and while colsa has some arabic experts those skills are not widely distributed “one of the things about jihadis they are very good in arabic said one specialist who worked on webops another former employee said common translation mistakes he personally witnessed including the “palestinian salad” example were the result of the company hiring young people who were faking language abilities he mockingly described the conversations between managers and potential hires “‘do you speak arabic he mimicked “‘yes how do you say ‘good morning oh you can do that you are an expert you are hired a third specialist said she asked a colleague who was assigned to analyze material written in arabic why he was discarding much of it while watching a soap opera online the colleague said the material was irrelevant because it was in farsi or urdu but when she checked it was indeed arabic she has since left webops to find more meaningful work she said the webops arabic program focuses on syria iraq and yemen but for most of the time colsa has been running it it has had no syrian or yemeni staff the ap was told in separate interviews with two current employees and one who left recently engaging in theological discussions on social media with people who are well versed in the quran is not for beginners iraq and syria are riven with sectarian violence between shiite and sunni muslims who follow different interpretations of islam multiple workers said that webops “experts” often trip up on language that is specific to one sect or region “people can tell whether you are local or whether you are sunni or shia said another former worker so poorly crafted messages are not effective he said he left webops because he was disgusted with the work a number of the workers complained to ap that a large group on staff from morocco in north africa were often ignorant of middle eastern history and culture or even the difference between groups the u.s. considers terrorist organizations the group was so dominant that colleagues jokingly referred to them as “the moroccan mafia.” a lot of them “don’t know the difference between hezbollah and hamas said the employee who left to find more meaningful work hezbollah is an iran-backed shiite group based in lebanon hamas based in the gaza strip and the west bank is the palestinian branch of the sunni muslim brotherhood cathy dickens a vice president for business management and corporate ethics at colsa corp. referred questions to centcom which declined comment “you shouldn’t grade your own homework” to determine whether webops actually dissuades people from becoming radicalized colsa’s scoring team analyzes the interactions employees have online and tries to measure whether the subjects’ comments reflect militant views or a more tolerant outlook three former members of its scoring team told the ap they were encouraged by a manager to indicate progress against radicalism in their scoring reports even if they were not making any the employee who said she left to find meaningful work recalled approaching a colsa manager to clarify how the scoring was done shortly after starting her job she said he told her that the bottom line was “the bread we put on the table for our children.” the boss told her that the scoring reports should show progress but not too much so that the metrics would still indicate a dangerous level of militancy online to justify continued funding for webops she said she was shocked “until my dying day i will never forget that moment she said she like other former employees spoke only on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from colsa that could affect future employment the manager she spoke to declined to comment ap withheld his name because of security concerns employees and managers routinely inflate counts of interactions with potential terrorist recruits known as “engagements according to multiple workers engagements are delivered in tweets or comments posted on social media to lists of people and can also be automated that automation is at times used to inflate the actual number of engagements said two former workers including the one who talked about colleagues faking their language abilities the worker who left in disgust explained that a single tweet could be programmed to be sent out to all the followers of a target individually multiple times so the targets and their followers get the same tweets tagged to them over and over again “you send it like a blind copy you program it to send a tweet every five minutes to the whole list individually from now until tomorrow the former employee said “then you see the reports and it says yesterday we sent engagements often that means one tweet on twitter.” the person said that he saw managers printing out the skewed reports for weekly briefings with centcom officers but the volume made it look like the webops team’s work was “wow amazing he said garcia said colsa has a done a good job under his watch that the data is sufficiently scrutinized and the program is succeeding in a group of more than defense department data specialists came to tampa to evaluate the program their unclassified report obtained by ap identified what one of the authors called “serious design flaws.” for instance the report found that any two analysts were only percent likely to agree on how to score a particular engagement the author said a rate of percent or higher is required to draw useful conclusions the report found that computers would be as accurate or better than analysts and could evaluate effectiveness more quickly and cheaply what central command really needed the report said was outside oversight “you shouldn’t grade your own homework said the author a former u.s. military officer and data specialist once stationed at central command the author one of many people who signed off on the report spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of professional retribution he said the report was given to officers including garcia and to colsa the author said the suggestions were not implemented and webops managers resisted multiple attempts at oversight the author said that when he directly appealed to garcia for outside assessment an officer under garcia said the effort would cloud the mission “the argument was that webops was the only program at central command that was directly engaging the enemy and that it couldn’t function if its staff was constantly distracted by assessment he said the argument worked he said and colsa was not forced or instructed to accept outside oversight garcia disputed that account but would not elaborate on what steps were taken to address the defense department data specialists’ concerns the government accountability office issued a report in on webops oversight but it is classified “untouchable” despite the problems behind the scenes at webops central command will play a key role in the new million psychological operations campaign against the islamic state and other groups the five-year contract was a hefty commitment to “degrade and ultimately defeat extremist organizations according to a document detailing the scope of the work it would run parallel to webops the request for bids was announced in april four separate teams of companies competed for the contract including one led by defense giant northrop grumman from the start competitors complained among themselves that simon bergman an executive with the british advertising firm m c saatchi had an advantage because he was friends with garcia bergman was working with northrop to prepare the bid a former british officer bergman was deployed to iraq while garcia was there working on psychological operations during the iraq war it was well known that the two men were close and in recent years contractors often saw bergman at centcom offices in april defense contractor caci international held a meeting in tampa to discuss the bid three contractors on the team said a caci manager warned a roomful of people that garcia had already told him that he would decide who got the contract the manager said that garcia indicated that having bergman on the team would help so in mid-september when a photo appeared on facebook showing garcia and bergman together in the florida keys it did not look good in the eyes of many contractors garcia’s girlfriend captured the old friends inside the tiki bar at gilbert’s resort in key largo they were on her facebook page shoulder-to-shoulder smiling and giving the thumbs up within days the photos had been taken down from her page two weeks later the government announced northrop had won the contract its team included m c saatchi bergman’s firm a panel led by the u.s. general services administration chose the winner of the contract chris hamm a senior gsa acquisition executive said a five-member team scrutinized the technical merits of the proposals for the contract that team was led by two gsa officials and included three military officers one of whom was marine corps lt. col. matt coughlin who reported directly to garcia before garcia left his post coughlin is the information operations’ liaison with contractors in an interview with ap hamm said the contract award was handled properly “the process is designed to avoid bias hamm said but several other contractors on losing teams said coughlin would clearly have been the person on the panel with the most sway because of both his technical expertise and the fact that he represented centcom and given coughlin’s ties with garcia they found that troubling garcia said that while the bids were being considered he stayed away from any discussions of it with coughlin his deputy so he didn’t even realize the award announcement was imminent when he went with bergman to the keys “i wasn’t involved with the contracting process at all garcia said “so i had no idea what the timing of the contract was.” when asked why the photo with bergman was taken off facebook garcia declined to comment bergman said that his friendship with garcia one of many he has with military officers is irrelevant he noted that m c saatchi was only a subcontractor “i don’t see why my relationship with somebody in the military would have any influence over anything he said the whistleblower complaint however filed in december with central command’s inspector general contended the photo of garcia and bergman created a “clear impression and perception of impropriety.” the four-page complaint now under investigation by ncis said the atmosphere at the centcom division with routine drinking at the office and myriad conflicts of interest led to an “air of untouchable invincibility.” several contractors who spoke to ap among the nearly two dozen

's doors to citizens from seven muslim counties and syrian refugees and an amendment of the extradition policy might lead to the awakening of the islamophobic policies that have been ongoing in the u.s. since the attacks trump managed to make a great show of saying what muslims have not noticed for years something that could be the antidote to islamophobia even sunday 's developments alone could prove this prediction to be correct many articles about trump 's steps have and could be written but i would like to focus on what the u.s. 's changing policy on syria means and what it could change for turkey trump could be accused of being extremely hawkish and intervening against turkey 's interests to the same extent that the obama administration 's policy on syria was accused of keeping its nose clean of course it is too early to say anything definite yet president recep tayyip erdoğan and trump have not come together yet and the u.s. has not made its policy on syria clear however if not properly guided trump might act quickly and unknowingly in an attempt to make up for lost time the new u.s. president worried ankara with the question of whether the safe zone that he vowed to establish in syria could include the democratic union party pyd -held region now he plans to change strategy in the fight against daesh the news that infiltrated u.s. media suggesting that the trump administration wants to deploy american troops and helicopters in the area as part of the raqqa operation indicates that the u.s. has a plan to return to the middle east what matters most however is the question of how the u.s. will return turkey has constantly proposed the u.s. establish a terrorist-free safe zone in northern syria over the past five years but the u.s. did not respond to the proposal the call by ankara aimed to mop up pyd elements does trump mean the same thing while proposing to establish a safe zone now i do not think so as the u.s. still uses the pyd as a ground force moreover as hürriyet daily 's foreign policy writer verda Özer wrote on sunday the question of against who the safe zone will be established might pose problems for both the u.s. and russia this is because the u.s. russia and turkey all differ on who they want cleared out of the region in other words the issue of a safe zone does not have the same meaning as it had five years ago on the other hand some of trump 's messages push us to ask whether he aims for a coalition including turkey and the pyd in the anti-daesh fight obviously the trump administration wants to work with ankara again it says that turkey 's rapport with russia stemmed from the absence of the u.s. in the region vowing that it will re-ensure the old balance by returning to the region it also states that there is a need to develop an integrated strategy with syrian kurds while trump is making plans to bring together turkey and the pyd ankara harshly rejects this approach it seems this atmosphere will continue until the erdoğan-trump meeting i think erdoğan will be able to convince trump on the pyd issue in that meeting certainly the pyd is not a power that can be compared to turkey the most important goal for a u.s. that aims to return to the region will be to receive the support of turkey the greatest power in the region Donald Trump U.S. presidency, arising.

new hampshire 's two democratic u.s senators both say they plan to vote against jeff sessions for attorney general sen. jeanne shaheen explained her decision on nhpr’s morning edition i think his involvement in crafting that has been reported in crafting these executive orders raise serious questions about what he would do as attorney general she said sen. maggie hassan says she will also vote no on sessions after reviewing senator sessions’ record his testimony before the judiciary committee and reports of his influence on the development of president trump’s backdoor muslim ban that will make our country less safe i do not have confidence that senator sessions would be an independent attorney general who would put the rights of all americans before the whims of this president hassan wrote in a statement the senate judiciary committee is set to vote on the alabama senator’s confirmation tuesday if approved the full senate could hold a vote by the end of the week shaheen has been highly critical of president donald trump executive order on immigration and refugees calling it un-american and grossly inhumane trump’s order bans travel from seven muslim-majority countries for days and restricts new refugees for days the full transcript of shaheen 's interview is below president trump last night fired acting attorney general sally yates for what trump described as a betrayal of his administration for refusing to defend the executive order on immigration and refugees what’s your reaction to his decision i think it shows even more why this executive order is a problem what we heard from the acting attorney general is that she didn’t think it was defensible because she thought it was in violation of the constitution which we’ve already heard several courts agree with it’s important for the president it’s important for every elected official to try to follow the law this executive order i believe is un-american it raises constitutional questions and it was implemented totally incompetently there were a lot of questions asked there was a lot of confusion people at the department of homeland security didn’t know it was coming and weren’t told about how to enforce it for all kinds of reasons this is a very bad decision for president trump and his administration florida senator marco rubio says staff was told by state department officials that they’ve been instructed not to discuss the executive order with members of congress how concerned are you about the lack of information from the administration about this order and whether they’re complying with the stay issued by a federal judge that’s another very serious question one of the things we’ve seen since donald trump took office is an effort to keep federal agencies from giving information to the public on their websites as senator rubio pointed out in terms of staff and how things are being implemented this is something that i hope congress is going to take a look at i think the order is un-american it’s in violation of the values that we hold so dear in this country this is a country that was built on immigrants where we have provided safe haven to refugees who are fleeing war i think we would all agree that if there are ways we can make our vetting process for refugees more effective we want to do that but this is not the way to do it and i’m particularly concerned also because one of the groups of people we are keeping out are those iraqis who helps our men and women on the ground during the conflict in iraq the interpreters who are part of a special immigrant visa program who can come to the united states when their lives are threatened last night i talked to one of those former interpreters for our iraqi troops on the ground who talked about the concern she had about she’s fortunately made it into the country but about other people she knows who are stuck not knowing what’s going to happen to them and fear for their lives this is not the kind of picture we want to present of america it sends a message to our allies who we want to help us in this conflict against global terrorism and it also sends a message to the terrorists they’re going to be able to use this as a recruitment tool to get people to sign up to show that america is against islam it was not well thought out it was not well implemented and i hope the president is going to take another look and rescind it what are your biggest concerns about this order going forward and what can democrats really do to stop any of this because we don’t have the majority of votes in congress there are a number of things we can do to try to get the attention of the administration but the reality is this is the kind of thing that the white house needs to hear from people in the grassroots across this nation about we’ve seen that with people gathering at airports and marching to express their concerns gov sununu needs to hear from people in new hampshire if they’re concerned about it his family are immigrants just like my husband’s family he should appreciate the contribution that immigrants make to this country because he’s descendants of one of those families they should let their legislators in concord know because this is the kind of thing that’s going to be changed if enough people in the country express their views and let the trump administration know this is not something we want to see in america will you vote for jeff sessions as attorney general i’m not planning to vote for him i think his involvement in crafting that has been reported in crafting

this story is by both rachel waldholz and elizabeth jenkins with alaska’s energy desk federal agencies and scientists both inside and outside government endured a roller coaster of a week as president donald trump’s new administration took the reins many worry that funding for science and environmental research could be on the chopping block under the new president along with public communication about climate change but so far the only sure thing is nothing’s for sure for those who study climate change or communicate about it it was not a reassuring first week listen now memos went out to employees at the departments of interior and agriculture limiting public communication the white house removed sections of its website on climate change and the environmental protection agency at first said it would follow suit then backtracked this came on top of the new president’s own statements on climate change in the past trump has called global warming a hoax he later said he was joking and said during the campaign he’d “cancel” the paris agreement to limit carbon emissions though after the election he told the new york times he’s keeping an “open mind.” to larry hinzman vice chancellor for research at the university of alaska fairbanks it all points to one thing he expects federal funding for climate research to drop “i’m sure that there will be less of an emphasis on climate research hinzman said “there’s just no question that’s going to be true.” hinzman said alaska is a hub for climate research and “the lion’s share” of funding for that work comes from the federal government he hopes the university can shift its emphasis “we will reorient our efforts he said “still doing very similar work still looking at how our terrestrial ecosystems are evolving still looking at how fisheries change…looking at shipping we’ll still be doing a lot of work that was related to climate research it just has other foci now other purposes.” hinzman spoke thursday at the alaska marine science symposium which gathered scores of scientists in anchorage many of them focused on the effects of climate change one of them was carin ashjian a scientist at the woods hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts she worries the new administration doesn’t value basic science “i’m very concerned ashjian said “i see an atmosphere of hostility toward science that i think is unfounded and i also think it’s against the national interest.” it’s in the nation’s interest she said to understand how the environment is changing so communities industry and government agencies can plan for those changes for brendan kelly director of the study of environmental arctic change the key concern is that federal researchers be allowed to work free of political influence kelly served in the white house office of science and technology policy under former president barack obama “the gold standard of high-quality science that comes out of this country and has for a long time is threatened when any entity of government congress the administration whatever starts to meddle with that peer-reviewed process kelly said but kelly said it’s too soon to say what the trump administration will do “i start by saying to everybody take a deep breath kelly said with the reminder that all transitions are messy that was also the message at the mendenhall glacier visitor center in juneau last monday jan. john neary the visitor center’s director got an email it was from the united states department of agriculture his boss “it said stop all media until we review how this is going to move forward neary said “it’s not abnormal to get that kind of a memo at the change of a presidential administration.” neary has worked for federal agencies for over years he said he’s seen this kind of directive during transitions before back when president obama was sworn into office and during the bush administration before that the next day he received another message from the higher-ups it said the mendenhall glacier visitor center could continue “normal communications.” neary said that includes posting on social media about climate change he said it’s not a political issue “it is real it is happening we can see it out our windows neary said “we understand based on all the facts that it’s in part because of our actions as humans on earth and we’ll continue to say that but we’ll say it in an engaging positive way that connects people instead of just infuriates people.” neary said unless he hears otherwise that’s the plan for now it’s business as usual at the mendenhall glacier Rachel Waldholz Elizabeth Jenkins Energy Desk.

a little bottle is getting some big attention from the maine legislature “nips” liquor bottles have moved from hotel minibars and airline service carts into convenience stores across maine and the discarded empties are piling up along the roadways lawmakers have proposed placing a deposit on the little containers alberta surdick the bangor redemption and discount beverage center’s general manager is always anxious to increase business but she’s not crazy about the prospect of her crews hand-sorting empty 50-milliliter booze bottles in fact she said she questions the sanity of anyone who would even consider such an idea “i think they’re nuts plain pure and simple they’re nuts she said surdick’s team of more than a dozen sorters can quickly count and organize an onslaught of returnables as if it were second nature she said throwing nips bottles into the disposable stream would bog down the works and increase labor costs “these guys are really used to the fact that they know how many they’re picking up in each hand as they’re counting them be it two or three in each hand and they’re counting by that she said “these little bitty things there’s no telling how many you’re going to grab in a handful so they’ve really got to double their efforts as to what they’re looking at do we even take it do we have a distributor did it come from maine there are about a half-dozen bills seeking to expand maine’s bottle bill to include not only nips bottles but any bottle containing an alcoholic beverage that is smaller than milliliters most of the sponsors including democratic state rep. betty austin of skowhegan say they have been approached by constituents who are annoyed by the emerging roadside litter problem “different people who live in different areas of my town have even spoken about the bottles being there and that they’ve picked up a lot of bottles she said “in fact i was at a breakfast this morning and a woman from durham said she finds them all the time so apparently it’s all over our state.” one of the returnable deposit expansion bills will be the focus of a public hearing wednesday before the legislature’s environment and natural resources committee rep. lance harvell a farmington republican and co-sponsor of ld said there’s really only one way to get these recyclable containers off the road “if something’s worth something when people are cleaning up the roads they tend to either pick them up or if it’s worth cents they don’t throw ‘em out he said “that’s the idea behind these things is that so far with the way we’ve done this in the past with other bottles that’s been helpful in keeping those particular ones that have the deposit off the side of the road.” but among the opponents are redemption centers and liquor distributors “first of all as you can imagine applying a label to a very small bottle like that is both difficult and very labor intensive that affects the costs said jay hibbard vice president of government relations for the distilled spirits council of the united states hibbard said maine would be the only state besides iowa to impose a returnable deposit on the small bottles a process that would require the state’s liquor distributor to apply a deposit label to each bottle while there is a variety of potent beverages sold in 50-milliliter bottles being found throughout maine one brand fireball accounts for far more sales than any other at burby bates beverage center in orono manager jeff seney said the cinnamon-flavored whiskey is a preferred item among his younger customers and warrants its own custom freezer filled with 50-milliliter nips seney said if maine was to adopt a deposit on nips bottles that could affect not just the demand but the supply as well “a lot of the big companies they have a lot of pull and if it’s going to cost them on their bottom line to add something in they might just say ‘hey we’re just not going to ship to maine he said and that would be another way to address the problem of discarded nips bottles littering the state’s highways this article appears through a media partnership with maine public Maine Legislature. “Nips” roadways.

clean sweep how washers in schools boost attendance and improve day-to-day life for the neediest students barnum the growth vs. proficiency debate and why al franken raised a boring but critical issue betsy devos’s nomination as education secretary moved forward after a bitter party-line vote by the senate education committee and an unusually rancorous process that galvanized her opponents frayed senate relations and raised the spectre that some republicans could defect when the vote reaches the full body the intention of committee democrats to block devos was in play right to the end when there was some procedural drama over whether a ‘yes’ proxy vote by sen. orrin hatch who was not present at first should be counted in the split more significantly though were statements by two republican members of the health education labor and pensions committee sens lisa murkowski of alaska and susan collins of maine that they haven’t yet decided to vote for devos on the floor “i also said that when it comes to the vote on her confirmation don’t count on my vote murkowski emphasized in a written statement released after the hearing republicans hold a majority in the senate if as expected all democrats vote against devos it would take three gop “no” votes to sink her nomination sen. lamar alexander the committee chairman didn’t entertain that scenario telling reporters he believes devos will be confirmed and that the antagonism surrounding her nomination won’t impair her effectiveness as secretary the timeline for the full senate vote is up to majority leader mitch mcconnell “i think she’ll be an excellent education secretary alexander said at the end of the hearing “mrs devos cares about children she should get credit for that for her work on behalf of children.” the fight over the next education secretary comes amid a larger national upheaval that this week featured president donald trump first banning travel from seven muslim-majority countries then firing the acting attorney general for refusing to defend an order she deemed illegal alexander tied some of that turmoil to devos’s nomination “this recent election and what has happened since then frankly has got people on edge and it’s carried over to the committee said the tennessee republican himself a former education secretary under george bush even with that high-stakes showdown between the white house and the justice department and the preceding waves of protest over the immigration crackdown the nomination of devos a billionaire philanthropist major republican donor and staunch school choice advocate still commanded significant attention and dissent senators said their offices were flooded with calls opponents held rallies outside the capitol and across the country and anti-devos advocacy became a rallying cry on social media supporters portrayed devos as an independent voice dedicated to providing better educational opportunities to low-income children saying her nomination had inappropriately become a political pawn the gop firewall expected to hold on devos nomination but it’s been an unusually scorching battle after the vote statements poured in from advocacy groups on both sides of the nomination wade henderson president and ceo of the leadership conference on civil and human rights said the gop majority made a “crucial mistake” in moving devos’s nomination forward “betsy devos is simply unqualified and unprepared to be the nation’s secretary of education henderson said in a statement “at a time when the majority of public school students in america are children of color or from low-income families the nation needs a secretary of education who has demonstrated a clear commitment to enforcing our education laws and protecting students’ civil rights.” former florida gov jeb bush president and chairman of the foundation for excellence in education said devos deserved the committee’s support and remains focused on helping children despite weeks of “partisan gamesmanship.” “i know she will work tirelessly to improve the future of every child especially those who have been stuck too long in failing schools betsy’s long-standing commitment to innovation choice and accountability create the exact formula needed to empower states and parents to transform education in america bush said when it comes to those who will decide devos’s nomination the votes of murkowski and collins were and will continue to be the most closely watched the two moderate republicans are seen as among the most likely to buck the party line and oppose the michigan gop leader collins and murkowski argued that presidents are entitled to deference on nearly all occasions in appointing members of their cabinets at least in advancing those appointments to the full senate but that they still had concerns about devos’s nomination devos’s advocacy work on charter schools and private school choice “raises the question of whether or not she fully appreciates that the secretary of education’s primary focus must be on helping states and communities parents teachers school board members and administrators strengthen our public schools collins said she also raised concerns about devos’s confirmation hearing flubs on federal protections for students with disabilities saying she was “surprised and concerned about mrs. devos’s apparent lack of familiarity” with the individuals with disabilities education act the devos pledges not to gut public schools or force school choice during confirmation hearing murkowski too said she was concerned devos’s vision of charters and private choice wouldn’t work for the public schools in rural remote alaska continuing comments she raised during the jan. hearing devos has met with murkowski twice and received many commitments from the nominee including to visit alaska schools the senator said but “she has not yet earned my full support murkowski said procedural standoff bipartisan spirit tarnished the committee recessed briefly after the committee voted the first time to advance devos’s nomination democrats argued that committee rules prohibited hatch’s proxy vote from being the deciding one if the result otherwise would be a tie a squabble ensued over whether democrats had raised their objections before the committee clerk read the final tally and then whether a second vote with hatch present complied with rules requiring advance notice of committee votes the parliamentary spat also affected an amendment by ranking democrat patty murray to change the committee’s rules to require cabinet nominees to release three years of tax returns just because trump in a break with longstanding practice didn’t release his tax returns doesn’t mean nominees should be held to the same lower ethical bar she said “i believe in these unprecedented times with president trump nominating a cabinet of millionaires billionaires and ceos with incredibly complex financial entanglements and conflicts of interest the bar should be raised she said murray had previously unsuccessfully asked for devos to release tax returns her amendment was defeated on a party-line vote democrats and republicans primarily alexander continued their ongoing disagreement over whether there had been sufficient vetting of the nominee devos’s hearing and the vote on her nomination had both been delayed after democrats said more time was needed for her financial and ethics disclosures to be reviewed murray asked for a third postponement monday saying there was not enough time to go through devos’s answers to nearly written questions responses which the democrats said were insufficient alexander at both the beginning and end of hearing reiterated the extent of the devos review minutes more of public hearings than obama’s education secretary nominees plus answers to questions times greater in number than what republicans asked of john king and arne duncan democrats argued that devos did not have a long public record on education unlike duncan who had been superintendent of chicago public schools or king who had served in the u.s. education department and as state commissioner in new york and her nomination required additional review the help committee has long had a tradition of bipartisanship despite a wide right-left split among individual members alexander cited the committee’s work last congress to pass the every student succeeds act which overhauled no child left behind and what’s often called “21st century cures a law to speed approval of new drugs and boost medical research “i hope we can get back to that way of working soon but i think we have to face the facts and say we disagree about process we disagree about the nominee and we’re at the point where we need to express those disagreements by a vote he said murray for her part said it was the first time in her memory that the committee voted despite a ranking member’s lingering questions about a nominee “i consider this to be a massive break with that strong bipartisan record and it will dramatically impact our ability to work together in good faith going forward she warned the dick betsy devos family

in an emotional and at times contentious stretch of speeches that lasted more than an hour tuesday colorado house democrats passed a resolution asking president donald trump to lift the executive order he issued last week that banned entry to the country of refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly muslim countries and that sparked protests around the country and legal action that resulted in a partial stay of the order issued saturday evening trump has been defiant in the wake of the action citing national security and pushing back against objections voiced by members of congress more than concerned state department personnel and foreign leaders around the world the colorado’s resolution sponsored only by democrats in both the house and senate is unlikely to pass in the republican-controlled senate much less influence trump’s thinking but supporters touted it as an important statement for the record on behalf of their constituents “patriotism is supporting your country all of the time and your government when it deserves it said rep. chris hansen d-denver one of the prime sponsors of the resolution he was quoting mark twain “we have an example in this order of power being derived from fear i ask us to reject that.” rep. dafna michaelson jenet d-commerce city another prime sponsor decried the order as bad governing the policy put into effect with the order played an especially controversial part as a stump position in an especially controversial campaign last year and was destined to be even more controversial once it was issued from the white house that it came with little notice to lawmakers or guidance for cabinet members and immigration officials on the ground virtually ensured its negative reception “i happened to be in the airport on saturday traveling to los angeles michaelson jenet said “i watched people including two of our representatives speak to the fear and chaos of what was happening we all want a safe america we all want a vetting process that keeps out terrorists but we didn’t have a process there was no conversation there was no legislative debate that may have tamed the fear and chaos that ensued “i hope that we as a body serve our state better than i feel our nation is being served by the leaders in washington she said republican lawmakers mostly kept out of the speaker’s well they partly thought the order was being misrepresented in its effect and its motivation and partly seemed more than ready to move beyond the tumult that has followed each new day of the first week and a half of the trump presidency and onto more of the consequential legislative work of the state house minority leader patrick neville r-castle rock said his caucus fully recognized and embraced the fact that the united states is a nation of immigrants the order was meant to temporarily halt immigration from countries president obama also had included in a list of potentially dangerous would-be travelers to the states he said it wasn’t an attempt to ban muslims countries that lead in the world in immigrant populations were not included on the list he said in fact the order was less a comment on the countries on the list iran iraq libya somalia sudan yemen than it was on the u.s. broken immigration system “we have no power to change this immigration is the purview of the executive branch he said “we should be talking about problems we were sent here to deal with.” rep. yeulin willett r-grand junction said he didn’t plan on speaking but felt compelled to offer context he talked about the long shadow cast over the country by the terrorist attacks “we can’t do anything about this executive order it’s a federal issue he said “i hope i’m the only one who lost a relative in the towers on it was my cousin they couldn’t find his body he ended up in a landfill “these are tough issues but let’s not call out each other… we were never more galvanized than we were after john coloradostatesman.com Colorado House Democrats President Donald Trump Muslim Saturday evening.

over the weekend we learned that president trump signed an executive order banning travel to the united states from seven countries iran iraq sudan syria somalia libya and yemen there has been a great deal of confusion surrounding this action as the majority leader in the florida senate and as a senator representing florida’s 10th district whose everyday job is in farming and business i don’t pretend to have all the answers here’s what i do know i do not support travel restrictions on dual citizens green-card holders or any individual who has already gone through comprehensive screening before being allowed entrance to the united states this new executive order allows us to consider several important questions is our immigration process clear comprehensive thorough and well-managed people on both ends of the political spectrum agree that it’s not is the screening process adequate we need it to be to ensure national security do we trust our federal partners to do their due diligence as it relates to immigration they must because a smart process makes certain the world understands the principles that guide us for all these reasons i filed senate bill last year the objective was to give the florida department of law enforcement governor and attorney general the ability to gather more information about refugees attempting to resettle in florida my intent was not to turn away the innocent and the helpless as a world leader and a beacon of freedom it would be irresponsible for the united states to turn a cold shoulder to good people who need our help instead my legislation would be a step to ensure that the people of florida are protected from those who would come here under false pretenses a potential which we have to take seriously in fact as a former cia director testified before congress last year isis “is probably exploring a variety of means for infiltrating operatives into the west including refugee flows smuggling routes and legitimate methods of travel.” the president has explained he’s implementing this new temporary ban until he can assess the immigration process as it exists now and how increased scrutiny can effectively represent our values while also keeping us safe as our federal government continues to refine and enhance its immigration-vetting process i will continue the work that i put into sb we need greater cooperation between the federal government fdle and local officials for the benefit of floridians we learned a brutal lesson on and we vowed to never forget too often in recent years i fear that some federal immigration and national security agencies in washington lost sight of this lesson we know that there are forces in the world that would do harm to us and our nation we also know that these terrorists can inspire some of those already on our shores to join their cause in florida we saw that unfold in the most horrific way in the pulse nightclub attack on orlando the public criticism of new federal policies oddly ignores that under the previous administration president obama also implemented similar orders relating to these same seven countries they simply represent one tool that our national leaders can employ to uphold their most important duty to protect the nation from attacks within and from abroad we can and should continue to vigorously debate what we stand for as a people and a nation such debate has served us well and will continue to do so as we chart our course into the future part of that course is the delicate balance between compassion for the innocent victims in a dangerous world and the stark reality that freedom has enemies bent on bloodshed and destruction sen. wilton simpson r-trilby represents florida 's 10th district including citrus and hernando counties and a portion of pasco county he serves as the majority republican leader in the florida senate sen. wilton simpson r-trilby represents florida 's 10th district including citrus and hernando counties and a portion of pasco county he serves as the majority republican leader in the florida senate President Trump United States Libya Yemen.

women of color are front and center in the anti-trump resistance sally yates isn’t the only person doing the damn thang participants attend the women’s march on washington credit ap photo/sait serkan gurbuz before interim attorney general sally yates was promptly dismissed monday night she received national applause for refusing to enforce president donald trump’s muslim ban “at present i am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am i convinced that the executive order is lawful she wrote to her department of justice colleagues on monday it’s hard to say whether or not yates knew she’d be dumped for her defiance but her bold action showcased a trend that’s becoming more evident by the day women are leading the resistance against trump what’s even more striking is that women of color are front and center in the opposition movement as the fight against the 45th president enters its second week here are some of those women credit ap photo/cliff owen rep. maxine waters d-ca waters neither supported trump during his campaign she called him a “liar and a trickster” last september nor kept her criticism to herself after his election during an msnbc interview in december she said she had “no intention in pretending everything is alright” and would “fight him every inch of the way” as a member of the financial services committee she said she wouldn’t go to the white house if trump called and vowed to “show the american people that they too can not trust him.” waters was one of several congressional leaders who refused to attend trump’s inauguration in her capacity as a sitting member of the congressional black caucus she promised to fight trump’s attorney general nominee sen. jeff sessions r-al because of his racist track record and on tuesday waters also announced a bill to demand that trump be investigated for his dealings with russia credit ap photo/mark lennihan linda sarsour sarsour the executive director of the arab american association of new york was thrust into the national spotlight as one of the primary organizers of the women’s march on washington which had three times more people than trump’s swearing-in ceremony but sarsour was a well-known palestinian-american civil rights activist well before that she’s also fought islamophobia and slammed trump for his rallies which she called “racism summits.” after the women’s march sarsour was targeted by white supremacists on social media who falsely claimed that she condones islamic terrorism and sharia law but that didn’t deter her from using her spotlight to fight back following the announcement of trump’s muslim ban last friday sarsour took to the streets and rallied protesters in new york city on saturday “we got ta be really careful ’cause the opposition is ready but what they don’t know is that we’re ready too she said “while they are united around hate and divisiveness and racism and homophobia and xenophobia we are united by solidarity and love unity.” sarsour is also one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed monday by the committee on american-islamic relations cair against trump the secretary of the department of homeland security the state department and the director of national intelligence the suit claims trump’s muslim ban order is unconstitutional credit ap photo/jose luis magana sen. kamala harris d-ca as the junior senator from california elected the same day as trump harris hit the ground running “this issue of how we are treating our immigrants and in particular our undocumented immigrants is one of the most critical issues facing our country she said one day after the election in opposition to trump’s proposed wall and deportation rhetoric “we are not going to be achieving who we say we are as a country if we attack our community members our neighbors our friends and our colleagues.” harris hasn’t backed down since then not ten days later she said she would fight his affordable care act repeal effort although she attended the inauguration harris immediately tweeted that the country needs to be “louder about civil rights women’s rights and immigration.” she also called on people to “rise up” and promised to “defend roe v. wade and ensure that women can make their own choices about their bodies.” following up on that promise harris joined the women’s march on washington as a speaker “we are tired as women of being relegated to simply being thought of as a particular constituency or demographic she said “we will not retreat when being attacked we will stand up and we will fight.” harris created a petition on her website to oppose the confirmation of sen sessions after his nomination hearing to become the next attorney general “we need an attorney general committed to equal rights for all including women people of color and the lgbt community it is clear after his confirmation hearings that person is not jeff sessions she wrote on sunday harris also joined thousands of protesters outside the white house in response to the muslim ban credit ap photo/zach gibson sen. catherine cortez masto d-nv the first latina senator may be new to congress but she isn’t treading lightly she committed to opposing president as soon as she was elected using her victory speech in november to announce her fight “i’ll be one hell of a checks and balances on him she said “tonight we start our fight together.” since then the junior senator has been extremely vocal about trump’s cabinet picks “racism has no place in our justice system she tweeted in response to sessions’ nomination “the man supports anti-immigrant policies and was deemed too racist for federal judgeship by gop senate unacceptable.” she refuses to vote in favor of betsy devos trump’s choice to lead the department of education because devos “has no background in public education.” “while republicans are hoping to ram through her confirmation with as little public scrutiny as possible yesterday’s hearing made abundantly clear to me that betsy devos is not equipped to lead the department of education she said two days before the inauguration cortez masto proudly walked in the march on washington alongside a delegation from her home state “we are not going to tolerate anybody coming in and trying to take anything away from us she said in an interview with the las vegas review-journal “we are going to use our voice and stand together united.” on monday she co-sponsored a bill introduced by senate democrats that would force trump to rescind his muslim ban “this reckless and overly broad executive order was hastily put together without consulting congress or key federal agencies and it has already caused chaos and distress for families across the country she said in a statement “we can not stand idle while president trump unilaterally creates policy based on xenophobia enough is enough.” credit ap photo/j scott applewhite rep. linda sanchez d-ca sanchez is another california lawmaker determined to fight trump one of the battles she’s preparing for is the one to save obamacare “we’re gearing up for that fight california stands to lose a lot if aca is repealed she said one day before the inauguration “we are going to be getting the message out not just about the individuals who are impacted negatively if it goes away but the job losses that could occur and the fact that the state of california itself is at risk for losing billions of dollars in funding.” the same day sanchez told the los angeles times about her intention to become a thorn in trump’s side throughout his presidency “my role in the next four years is to be as vocal an advocate as i can for what my constituents want and need and i will put myself in donald trump’s path at every turn to confront him about these issues she said “i’m going to be the biggest pain in the neck that i can be.” like harris sanchez opted to attend the inaugural ceremony but on the same day she joined other members of the congressional hispanic caucus chc in denouncing the new president “we are here today on the day of inauguration to send a very clear message to our president the chc is going to stand up and fight for the rights of the hispanic community she said during a chc press conference “the president of the united states has made it abundantly clear including in his speech today that he is openly hostile to immigrants particularly immigrants of mexican ancestry.” on monday she also joined protesters of the muslim ban credit ap photo/paul sancya rep. judy chu d-ca yep it’s another californian this is chu’s eighth year in congress and she isn’t holding back this month the first-ever chinese-american congresswoman refused to attend the inauguration and slammed trump’s attack on civil rights icon rep. john lewis d-ga “in a diverse democracy like ours patriotic dissent is vital she said in a press release “the personal attacks on john lewis were just the latest example of behavior unbefitting a president.” her resistance to the new administration began in november when chu joined democrats to oppose white nationalist steve bannon’s white house appointment in a press release she said “after winning election to our nation’s highest office donald trump said his mission was to unite the country yet his first staffing choice does the complete opposite steve bannon has made a career out of inflammatory and offensive headlines about women minorities and political opponents that’s not perception that’s the reality and it’s why donald trump brought him on to lead his inflammatory campaign last saturday chu joined mass protest outside of lax where hundreds of people demanded that refugees and other immigrant detainees be released “closing the door to vulnerable refugees is shameful and against our values we must do all that we can to reverse trump’s muslimban order she tweeted the next day she rallied outside the supreme court with immigrants refugees and house democrats thang.

superbad dvd director greg mottola screenplay seth rogen evan goldberg mpaa rating r year of release stars jonah hill seth michael cera evan christopher mintz-plasse fogell bill hader officer slater seth rogen officer michaels martha mac isaac becca emma stone jules aviva nicola joe lo truglio francis the driver kevin corrigan mark clement blake homeless guy erica vittina phillips mindy joe nunez liquor store clerk it 's hard to know where to begin when describing superbad an uproarious teen comedy that pulls no punches even as it manages to interject a genuinely sweet message about the nature of friendship and maturity amidst all its cleverly parsed vulgarity so i 'll let the mpaa classification and ratings administration do some of it for me superbad contains “pervasive crude and sexual content strong language drinking some drug use and a fantasy/comic violent image all involving teens.” in other words it is perfectly honest about the late adolescent male experience in all its hilarious ugliness seth rogen who has achieved something very close to stardom with his lead role in knocked up and evan goldberg rogen 's childhood friend and writing partner started penning this teen opus about misfit best friends searching for booze and sex when they were in high school as a response to the kinds of formulaic teen movies they hated and it shows this is not though it might appear to be a slam quite the opposite in fact because rogen and goldberg were still at the age they were writing about their characters and situations have a ring of authenticity that is often lacking in even the funniest teen comedies the two main characters who are not-so-curiously named after the screenwriters are seth jonah hill and evan michael cera a perfectly mismatched odd couple jonah with his portly frame and wild hair is a libidinal explosion waiting to happen he is full of raucous energy and horndog passion although it often comes out as either anger or crudity evan on the other hand is reserved and thoughtful which he can be largely because seth provides enough energy for the both of them the entire story takes place on one of the last days of their senior year in high school and the cloud hanging over their heads is the knowledge that at the end of the summer evan will be going off to dartmouth while seth heads to a state school when seth and evan are unexpectedly invited to a party that night they promise to provide the alcohol courtesy of their geeky friend fogell 's christopher mintz-plasse newly minted fake id which proclaims his name to be mclovin in evan 's immortally hilarious deadpan observation his use of this id will result in one of two things the liquor store clerk will correctly identify fogell as yet another kid with a fake id or he will think “here 's mclovin the 25-year-old hawaiian organ donor.” the id does work but the actual procurement of the liquor is temporarily waylaid by an unexpected robbery of the liquor store which brings in two bumbling cops the seemingly clueless officer slater bill hader and the even more clueless officer michaels seth rogen thus seth and evan 's best-laid plans of getting booze being labeled heroes by all the thirsty partygoers and getting the girls are jeopardized which sends them on a new odyssey to procure more alcohol meanwhile fogell is off on an odyssey of his own with the two officers who are little more than overgrown adolescents themselves while this portion of the movie is frequently hilarious it is also the movie 's weakest because it does n't really fit with the rest of it granted the screenplay provides a coda that explains how the police officers are a part of the movie 's teen-centric perspective but it feels oddly tacked on the plot of course is just set-up and nothing about it is particularly original or even all that clever what makes superbad work so well is the way in which the filmmakers have invested in the characters and the situations jonah hill and michael cera are both perfectly cast in their respective roles and they generate a palpable chemistry that works both comedically and dramatically and sometimes both at the same time one of the film 's funniest and most moving scenes is when they drunkenly proclaim their best-friend love for each other and then wake up feeling awkward the next morning director greg mottola is n't afraid to pile on the slapstick but he understands that superbad 's heart and soul is in the characters interactions whether it be seth berating fogell for his ridiculous decision to change his name to the highly unlikely “mclovin” or evan trying to deal with his longtime crush martha macisaac wanting to have clumsy drunken sex with him the situations throughout superbad are exaggerated and some of them are just downright bizarre wait until seth tells the story of his childhood obsession with male genitalia but they always have just the right ring of truth to them superbad treads a thin line between the absurd and the genuine which is the funniest place of all superbad two-disc unrated extended edition superbad is also available in rated and unrated single-disc editions and on blu-ray aspect ratio

especially in the daytime scenes the dolby digital surround soundtrack works quite well especially in crowd scenes like the cafeteria or at the various parties where the surround tracks create a thoroughly enveloping environment supplements considering the contributors to the audio commentary director greg mottola producer judd apatow writers seth rogen and evan goldberg and actors michael cera jonah hill and christopher mintz-plasse it does n't require a real leap of imagination to guess that it is quite a rollicking affair the entire group was recorded together although half of them were in new york and half were in los angeles at the time and they spent most of commentary laughing joking and generally talking over each other the second disc opens with seven deleted and extended scenes all of which are presented in anamorphic widescreen and run a total of about minutes none of them are particularly good so it 's not hard to see why the material was cut “cop car confessions” is a series of shorts featuring bill hader and seth rogen 's incompetent cops driving with various people who are played by such actors as jane lynch chris kattan and justin hill many of these shorts have already appeared on the internet but it 's nice having all of them together in one place there is a definite sense that the cast and crew had a lot of fun making the film which is plenty evident in “the making of superbad a 13-minute behind-the-scenes featurette as well as the minutes of “on-set diaries.” several other featurettes show how the cast and crew got along during and outside of production including the four-minute “snakes on jonah which documents how director greg mottola celebrated jonah getting his tonsils taken out by paying a couple of aussie animal wranglers to come over and give him firsthand experience with giant snakes iguanas and cockroaches jonah who admits to a fear of reptiles and animals looks positively petrified at various points there are also some amusing fake featurettes including “everybody hates michael cera a jokey bit about how no one likes working with the eponymous actor and “press junket meltdown in which jonah and michael are interviewed by a rude brit “line-o-rama” is essentially four minutes of the actors saying different variations of some of the movie 's funniest lines and the gag reel is four minutes of on-set screw-ups pratfalls jonah hill 's cell phone ringing and malfunctioning vomit special effects believe it not they actually had broadcast television in mind while shooting superbad and the three-minute featurette “tv safe lines” shows how they went about shooting alternate dialogue that would be acceptable to network standards and practices they only show two brief scenes and their alternate versions both involving jonah hill 's dialogue natch but i imagine they had to shoot at least half the movie this way “the vag-tastic voyage” is the complete version although still only a minute and a half long of the porn film seth evan and fogel are watching at the beginning of the movie much more interesting is video footage from two “table reads” of the script one back in with seth rogen reading the part of seth and one in with the actors who appeared in the film there are also minutes of audition footage of cera hill who was shot on the set of knocked up and mintz-plasse finally there is a four-minute excerpt from the upcoming film pineapple express which stars seth rogen and james franco and i would be remiss if i did n't mention that the animated menus contain many many

abc news new york abdallh khadra’s 3-year-old daughter muna has gone to bed thousands of miles away from him every night for the past three months her pink barbie bed back home in north carolina lays empty khadra’s fight to get muna back took a desperate turn friday when president trump signed an executive order to instate an immediate travel ban on refugees and people traveling to the u.s. with visas from seven majority muslim countries including syria where muna was born “we don’t believe that we can not get her khadra said “we have to get her.” khadra fled his home country of syria after speaking out against the assad regime he was vetted and cleared for u.s. entry in on a religious work visa and his family joined him in on an october trip to see family in lebanon muna was the only member of his family denied entry back to the u.s. he says because of a visa snafu she has been living with her grandmother ever since but on monday he says he was told his daughter is now “ineligible” for u.s. entry “this is heartbreaking we can not believe this happened he said “what will a 3-year-old child what threat would she pose this past week alone over refugees were on their way to the u.s. according to an estimate from the united nations high commissioner for refugees the executive order by president trump on friday changed everything in an instant “this policy in regard with my family it’s breaking my family it’s breaking our hearts khadra said the order bars admission to the u.s. of all people with non-immigrant or immigrant visas from iraq iran libya somalia sudan syria and yemen for days it also bars entry to all refugees from anywhere in the world for days and places an indefinite ban on syrian refugees suddenly people’s lives were held in limbo on saturday a senior department of homeland security official told abc news that travelers were affected by the executive order at airports across the country within that group people were in transit and then denied entry to the u.s. were denied entry to the u.s. before boarding their flights in a foreign port and were granted waivers because of their legal permanent resident or special immigrant visa status department of homeland security officials on tuesday said that refugees will be allowed to enter the u.s. this week while defending president trump’s executive order on immigration and refugees a number of travelers to the u.s. including children were detained upon landing some on those incoming flights were barred from entering the country at all including fuad sharef suleman who had risked his life working with the u.s. government as a former subcontractor and had to return to iraq despite receiving a visa to enter the country “i don’t know what to do because i sold my house i quit my job my wife quit her job and kids left school he said on monday president trump fired acting u.s. attorney general sally yates for refusing to defend his immigration order after she said she was not convinced it was “lawful.” in a statement the white house said yates “betrayed the department of justice” and was “weak on borders” and replaced her as acting attorney general with by dana boente the u.s. attorney for the eastern district of virginia abdallh khadra was vetted he has been living in the u.s. for six years coming into the u.s. as an imam on a legal religious workers visa and later applying for political asylum he said he loves this country but doesn’t think this policy will abate terror “this type of decision it will only promote hate and fear and it will not solve the problem of extremists he said “just the other day that canadian white man he entered the mosque in quebec and killed people while they were praying so we don’t say ‘white men are terrorists.’ that is just foolish that is very unjust and very unfair this decision is very discriminatory very unjust very inhumane.” khadra was among those protesting the ban in raleigh north carolina like thousands of others around the country from new york under the shadow of the statue of liberty to the gates of the white house and at several major airports around the globe just as with the women’s march demonstrations the weekend before people in other countries joined in a reported anti-trump protesters took to the streets in the united kingdom outrage was also expressed in hollywood where several actors voiced their opposition to the executive order during their screen actors guild award speeches on sunday night and in a rare move just days into a new presidency former president obama spoke out with some harsh words for president trump saying he fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion but there is also a strong chorus of voices across the u.s. that are in support of the travel ban “take care of our own first and then take care of others lou colon of hazleton pennsylvania told wnep-tv “it’s just like when a plane goes into a crash mode first you have to put on your mask to help your child.” “i think we need first and foremost to keep our country safe valery brussat told abc milwaukee affiliate wisn-tv but hours after issuing the executive order the white house began to walk back part of that sweeping edict now saying green card holders permanent legal residents will be allowed to re-enter the country white house press secretary sean spicer defended the policy on monday telling reporters “i’m sorry that some folks may have had to wait a little while but i think the president would much rather know that he’s not placing a call to someone who was killed because someone was let into this country to commit a terrorist act.” the order grants some exceptions giving priority to refugees from religious minorities like christians living in majority muslim countries nermeen arastu a clinical law professor and attorney said she believes the mandate is unethical and unlawful “we’ve seen post-9/11 that in the name of security our country has allowed itself to erode many of its values arastu said “if the u.s. is now going to prioritize that they’re going to take refugees that are christian over refugees that are muslim that in and of itself is discriminating based on religion.” but president trump claimed the ban had nothing to do with religion telling reporters “it’s not a muslim ban but we’re totally prepared and it’s been working out very nicely.” the executive order unleashed a crush of bipartisan criticism from democratic lawmakers protesting on the steps of the supreme court monday night to republican senators john mccain and lindsey graham writing in a joint statement “it is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that president trump’s executive order was not properly vetted… ultimately we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.” president trump fired back at them on twitter saying “john mccain and lindsey graham… should focus their energies on isis illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start world war iii.” the president later adding on twitter “if the ban was announced with a one week notice the ‘bad’ would rush into our country during that week a lot of bad ‘dudes’ out there.” today people like sufyan who asked that his last name not be used remain caught in the crossfire of this debate he worked as a translator for the u.s. army in iraq and worked with the american forces for seven years and said he risked his life every day for dangerous assignments “i still remember when my brother got kidnapped because they were thinking that he was me he said “it is a dangerous place but it’s a must.” he got out of iraq using a special immigration via which allowed him to get a green card but for now those like him who risks their lives to help american forces or companies would not be allowed into the u.s. sufyan now lives in durham north carolina with his wife and three children his youngest daughter is an american born in the u.s he said the president’s executive order is difficult for him “don’t judge percent of the good people the same as percent bad people he said for khadra his foremost concern is the safety of his little girl still stranded half a world away “for me personally i want my daughter back he said

clothing line after the then presidential candidate made derogatory comments about mexicans trump also accused amazon of getting away with murder tax wise after accusing its ceo of other improprieties now insurgent candidates in virginia 's gubernatorial race one of the most closely watched contests of are employing the same combative technique their target energy giant dominion resources who critics says uses its political leverage to abuse property rights and overcharge its customers for electricity dominion the biggest corporate donor in virginia politics said its customers are happy with its service two out of four gop primary contestants are openly hostile to dominion and want to ban the company from making campaign donations an insurgent democrat is indicating he 'll make the company 's broad political influence a significant campaign talking point the jabs at dominion come as virginia 's gubernatorial race moves into the national spotlight it is one of two states along with new jersey to have scheduled gubernatorial elections in the country and trump fans and critics want to use the contest as a referendum on the president 's first months in office two gop candidates running say trump 's style of calling out companies by names resonated with voters and is something they will replicate somebody has to drag these vampires into the sunlight said gop candidate denver riggleman a distillery owner who battled dominion over eminent domain issues riggleman had a capitol news conference tuesday to pledge support for longshot legislation that would prohibit regulated monopolies from making campaign contributions a dominion subsidiary is a regulated electric utility that provides service to about two thirds of the state republican corey stewart a one-time trump campaign chairman in virginia said if elected he would support the ban on donations from regulated monopolies as well and would look at other areas to curb the company 's political influence they have virtually every member of the general assembly in their pocket stewart said stewart and riggleman are facing off against ed gillespie a former republican national committee chairman and state sen. frank wagner who has long been a strong supporter of dominion on the democratic side former congressman tom perriello is also making dominion 's influence a campaign issue tom believes our political system has become too rigged in favor of big corporations and special interests and that virginians suffer when the very politicians charged with regulating monopolies accept campaign contributions from them his spokesman ian sams said perriello is competing with lt. gov ralph northam the party 's establishment favorite who like virtually every politician in the state has received donations from dominion a spokesman for northam said he is committed to making sure we get best the deal for ratepayers both parties hold their primaries in june it 's unclear how much traction the candidates will get from attacking dominion which has massive resources to defend itself the company currently spends millions of dollars each year on positive advertising and charitable giving in addition to heavy spending on political campaigns and lobbying said company spokesman david botkins our million customers tell us they are very very happy with their low rates superb reliability cleaner air and an energy independent virginia but the company also has plenty of critics ranging from property owners who say the company infringes on their rights to environmentalists who say the company is too slow to embrace renewable energy sources businesses and consumer groups also complain that dominion has used its political power to set unnecessarily high electric rates dominion-backed legislation limiting the state corporation commission 's ability to set rates is costing a typical customer a year according to one business group 's calculations dominion disputes those figures populist-led efforts in virginia have not had much success in previous campaign cycles but riggleman said trump 's victory along with rep. dave brat 's surprise win over then u.s. house

in years as a london firefighter richard mommersteeg was expected to go into burning buildings to put out fires and save people turns out that was just a warmup for his “retirement” career working for the international medical aid organization doctors without borders or medecins sans frontieres msf for the last four years mommersteeg has been working in war zones in africa and most recently afghanistan helping to save countless lives even with the sound of shelling and gunfire in the background he works on providing all the services and equipment to allow the doctors and nurses to do their jobs “i get to be right beside them watching them save lives he said in a london interview “the babies that survive the moms who get to go home it feels good to be a part of that but the stress and danger is constant “you’re not the target but sometimes you are in wrong place at the wrong time.” he said two years ago american jets mistakenly bombed an msf hospital in afghanistan killing people mommersteeg retired from the fire department in but even before then he had done some short stints with msf while the agency’s main mission is providing medical aid it also needs staff like mommersteeg to handle logistics such as power water and the maintenance of equipment and buildings mommersteeg was first stationed in the central african republic from to helping to rebuild a hospital and providing aid to neighbouring villages it was peaceful at first but a political coup led to fighting that created tens of thousands of refugees and destroyed cities where basic water and sanitary services had to be rebuilt sometimes the msf staff had to retreat to “safe rooms” made of cinder block and metal shutters to escape the gunfire and machetes the staff never carry guns which makes them easy prey for robbers “there’s no confrontation we just hand over what they want mommersteeg said his next assignment was in the neighbouring democratic republic of congo where he was part of small medical emergency team that would travel into the countryside in two cars the situation on the ground was chaotic with dozens of armed factions fighting with each other msf tries to stay neutral and out of the fray “we treat whoever needs the health care so we are often treating the injured and wounded from both sides in the same hospital said mommersteeg then came his biggest challenge one he hoped his years as firefighter would prepare him for last may mommersteeg was moved to an msf hospital in lashkar gah in afghanistan’s helmand province three years ago canada withdrew all its forces from afghanistan site of the longest war in this country’s history one that claimed the lives of southwestern ontarians but the fighting goes on in afghanistan taliban fighters pushed into the town where mommrsteeg was stationed sometimes the fighting came within half a kilometre of the msf compound american and allied forces fought back with shelling bombers and drones one of mommersteeg’s jobs was to build a bullet-proof wall to protect the patients especially those in the pediatric ward at times the 300-bed hospital handled more than patients the msf staff was isolated and there were no flying out for breaks because the airport wasn’t safe another grim task for mommersteeg was building a bigger morgue out of a shipping container to handle the overflow of bodies eventually the constant fighting and danger forced mommersteeg to curtail his one-year commitment “the shelling drones and the machine-gun fire was almost constant every day said “six months was enough it wears on you.” after a brief rest in amsterdam and a few weeks back home in london he’s off to tunisia to support his partner ellen van der velden who is heading up an msf mission to deliver medical aid to african migrants rescued from boats trying to cross the mediterranean sea to reach europe “the situation there is horrendous a lot of the migrants are enslaved and abused he said although the danger he faced in afghanistan has left him a bit rattled mommersteeg said he’s determined to carry on his work “i do it because i can i still feel i have something to offer there’s not enough of us paying attention to what can be done.” hdaniszewski postmedia.com twitter.com/hankatlfpress London Richard Mommersteeg people.

skip to comments whoopi maybe the taliban 'started out like trump newsbusters kristine marsh posted on by markomalley tuesday on the view host whoopi goldberg led a segment based off of the ridiculous question is america becoming like the taliban whoopi referenced mondays show where co-host jedediah bila talked about terrorists hating american values like freedom and democracy tuesday whoopi wondered if it was actually america who hated freedom and was trading it in for taliban values with trump in the white house whoopi we keep hearing about terrorists hating about american values we had this conversation yesterday let me ask you now we have had a leader who 's repeatedly demeaned women wants to defund organizations that benefit women calling on the media to shut up specifically wants to give preferential treatment based on religion are these values really much different than the talibans i mean applause with a puzzled look co-host jedediah bila asked whoopi if she meant trumps values since she was referencing things hes done in office bila you 're talking about trump 's a values.. whoopi reiterated the values that we are listening to to which behar piped up in agreement theyre doing the same thing as the taliban bila shot back with the obvious bila there 's a difference between taliban who 's beheading people and chopping heads and a american president who may has policies you disagree with or may be saying things you disagree with whoopi but if he says i do n't like what you did you 're fired bila that 's different than chopping off peoples heads whoopi conceded it was different but she still felt like telling the media to shut up was the start of america becoming like the taliban whoopi it is but listen if you 're saying to the media shut up that 's what they do maybe they did n't start out chopping people 's heads off maybe they started out differently i 'm asking it it feels like it 's tricky because we 're saying to people here are our american values and then we 're saying on the same token stuff that sounds like the stuff we 're fighting so thats why i pose the question co-host joy behar then brought her favorite scapegoat the republican party into the discussion behar my question then is are trump 's values different from the republican party 's values because i do n't see them objecting to any of this after bila noted that several republicans had objected to the immigration order she reiterated that what the president does or says about women or refugees isnt why americans voted for him bila i do n't think that trump making comments that are horrific about women is representative of the way the united states at heart feels about women .they voted for taxes and they voted for health insurance plans and they voted for wanting to keep more of their hard-earned cash i dont think they voted for what he said about women behar responded by snarking behar so grab a woman by the genitals stop the press from talking is worth the low taxes video at link whoopi tried to further her taliban analogy again claiming that trump wanted america to have one religion. whoopi that brings me back to this question it brings me back to the question so the question is when you put some of these things side by side what kind of religion you 're supposed to have you 're supposed to have one religion bila people do n't see it as that they dont accept that premise hostin those are un-american values whoopi when he says this there 's preferential treatment for christians forgetting all the other religions out there bila you mean for the refugee program is that what youre talking about whoopi im talking about any time executive bila there 's a reason for that because in that country in syria christians are the minority religion later on whoopi reiterated again nobody tells our media to shut up and just take it thats how they do it the taliban. hostin ended the segment with an emotional rant about how this temporary ban was changing the entire reputation of america for the worse hostin he 's supposed to be the president of the united states of america he 's supposed to reflect the very american values that so many of us have when youre talking about america the bastion of peace the place you could go when you were tired and you were weak and you were persecuted you ca n't do it anymore how is that an american value topics business/economy government keywords to markomalley maybe whoopi inspired the taliban behold the power of maybe to markomalley and maybe retarted pigs can fly by

cape town south africa was let off the hook for the time being when the financial action task force fatf decided not to publicly rebuke the country for failure to sign into law amendments to the financial intelligence centre act fica at its plenary meeting held in paris from to february the international body that monitors compliance with anti-terrorism and anti money-laundering regulations deferred a decision to issue a public statement on south africa 's compliance with standards against money laundering and terrorist funding until its next meeting in june the plenary considered the fatf 's 12th mutual evaluation follow-up report on south africa 's process to remedy deficiencies identified in the mutual evaluation these deficiencies relate to gaps in legislation on adequate customer due diligence and record-keeping measures these are considered serious deficiencies and are addressed in the fic amendment bill on the agenda at the plenary was a proposal for the fatf to express its concern at south africa 's failure to address these deficiencies in the form of a public statement zuma 's reservations in november last year president jacob zuma referred the fica bill which had been passed by parliament in may already back to the national assembly citing concerns over a provision that pertained to warrantless searches read fica bill unconstitutional says zuma parliament 's standing committee on finance after another round of public hearings passed the bill on tuesday february it will be debated in the national assembly on tuesday and referred back to president jacob zuma who has one of two choices either sign it into law or refer it to the constitutional court to ascertain if it passes constitutional muster on monday national treasury and the financial intelligence centre fic welcomed the fatf 's decision to delay the public statement which has the potential to tarnish south africa 's reputation as a country with sound financial institutions and harm south african banks relationship with the international banking community sa 's motivation for fica bill delay national treasury deputy director-general ismael momoniat as well as the banking fraternity have warned on a number of occasions that a delay in signing the fica bill into law could render south africa non-compliant with international standards and regulations read sa faces dire consequences if fica bill not signed treasury momoniat was part of the south african delegation present at the plenary in paris where the fatf was requested to defer its public statement the delegation motivated the delay in the signing of the fica bill into law saying the process which the president followed in referring his reservations on the constitutionality of the relevant clause back to the national assembly is provided for in south africa 's constitution and is therefore consistent with legislative processes the delegation added that the issue which caused the president to refer the amendment bill back to the national assembly does not relate to the matters which south africa had to address in the course of the follow-up process and therefore in no way reflects a lack of political commitment to address these deficiencies the fatf will again consider the decision as to whether a public statement should be issued or not at its next plenary meeting which is due to take place from to june when it will next consider south africa 's progress in remedying the deficiencies identified in the mutual evaluation back on zuma 's desk yunus carrim anc chairperson of parliament 's standing committee on finance said the committee adequately dealt with zuma 's reservations about warrantless searches in its deliberations read heated public hearings into fica bill although the committee could choose to return the bill as it had been passed in may carrim said the committee clarified a number of matters among others that fic inspectors will not carry out searches that lead to criminal prosecutions and will only be concerned with compliance with the fic act read fin24 's top stories trending on twitter fin24 's top stories source news24 Cape Town South Africa Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA).

today heads of state from across africa adopted a declaration on universal access to immunization in africa in which they endorsed the addis declaration on immunization http //apo.af/9bslof a historic and timely pledge to ensure that everyone in africa regardless of who they are or where they live receives the full benefits of immunization the endorsement was issued during the 28th african union au summit in addis ababa ethiopia while africa has made impressive gains over the last years toward increasing access to immunization progress has stagnated and the continent is falling behind on meeting global immunization targets one in five children in africa still does not receive basic life-saving vaccines and as a result vaccine-preventable diseases continue to claim too many lives measles alone accounts for approximately preventable deaths in the african region every year “we know that universal access to immunization is achievable noted outgoing african union commission chairperson nkosazana dlamini-zuma “the addis declaration on immunization is a historic pledge with political support at the highest levels we are closer than ever to ensuring that all children in africa have an equal shot at a healthy and productive life.” the addis declaration on immunization calls for countries to increase political and financial investments in their immunization programmes it includes commitments including increasing vaccine-related funding strengthening supply chains and delivery systems and making universal access to vaccines a cornerstone of health and development efforts the full declaration can be found below “vaccines are among the most effective public health tools available said dr matshidiso moeti world health organization who regional director for africa “when children are given a healthy start communities thrive and economies grow stronger this show of support from heads of state is a significant step forward in our efforts to achieve universal access to immunization and ultimately improve child health and drive sustainable development across africa.” fewer than african countries fund more than of their national immunization programmes as africa nears polio eradication critical funding for immunization through the polio eradication programme is expected to ramp down additionally countries approaching middle-income status will transition away from gavi support for immunization in the coming years consequently governments must redouble their efforts to make universal immunization coverage a national priority “as long as even one child in africa lacks access to immunization our work remains unfinished said dr ala alwan who regional director for the eastern mediterranean “with the right mix of political will financial resources and technical acumen africa can and will stem the tide of vaccine-preventable diseases across the continent.” with strong leadership and investment increased access to immunization is within reach for example in ethiopia built new health centres purchased battery-free solar refrigerators for vaccine storage and built a network of millions of health extension workers and volunteers at community level to increase access to immunization throughout the country since these investments were made ethiopia has made remarkable gains with immunization rates soaring from in to in “immunization is one of the smartest investments a country can make in its future said h.e professor yifru berhan mitke ethiopia’s minister of health “we must do more to protect all our children from preventable diseases not only because it is the right thing to do but also because it makes economic sense when our children are healthy our families communities and countries thrive.” the addis declaration on immunization was signed by ministers of health and other line ministers at the ministerial conference on immunization in africa mcia in february in addis ababa mcia was the first-ever ministerial-level gathering with a singular focus on ensuring that children across the continent can access life-saving vaccines to guide the implementation of the adi a roadmap is being developed in close collaboration with the who offices in the african region and eastern mediterranean region the african union commission and immunization partners “african leaders are showing outstanding leadership by endorsing this landmark commitment which will allow more african children to be reached with life-saving vaccines no matter where they live said dr ngozi okonjo-iweala chair of gavi the vaccine alliance board “we must now ensure that the commitments translate into sustainable financing for immunization gavi stands ready to support african countries in their efforts to implement equitable health approaches and maintain strong immunization coverage so we can create together a more prosperous future for communities across our continent.” distributed by apo on behalf of who regional office for africa for more

high livestock prices means chatter surrounding using low cost grain for opportunity lot-feeding is likely to remain just that talk both grain and livestock industry leaders agree the concept of value-adding through lot-feeding has merit but say the current value structure means it is likely to be only a niche opportunity for both the lamb and cattle sectors this year “the cost of store livestock is still the major component of a lot-feeding operation and prices for store cattle and sheep remain very high said australian lot feeders association alfa president tess herbert “the current situation with low grain prices is an interesting dynamic and people are talking about opportunities but from our industry’s perspective cheap store livestock and good processing prices are a better thing than cheap grain she said geoff duddy owner of sheep solutions said crunching the numbers showed feedlotting merino wether lambs could pay off but it required a lamb cost price cheaper than current store values and extremely low grain prices he said a case could be made for lot feeding when the price of a store lamb was a head or less returns from the processor were over cents a kilogram carcase weight and cereal grain inputs were below a tonne currently lamb carcase weight values are in excess of 600c/kg but store lamb values are higher and grain prices often slightly above the break-even figure ms herbert said the most likely people to opportunity feedlot would be broadacre cattle and lamb producers finishing their own livestock in an intensive feeding environment “it will be done it may just be on a local scale and something we don’t hear about much at an industry level.” “we’re unlikely to see people setting up new enterprises on the back of the cheap grain but those that have had success with opportunity lot-feeding before may have another go this season.” however she said in general people would find the numbers did not quite stack up or that there was insufficient time to generate a return before other farm priorities in northern areas especially southern queensland a key lot-feeding region ms herbert said emerging concerns with dry conditions may stop people from embarking on a finishing program ron storey nzx agribusiness australia chief said value adding grain by lot-feeding lambs or cattle was a ‘nice thought’ but said the reality was that it was a difficult time consuming enterprise with relatively skinny margins “it’s a nice thing to think about but it is a pretty specialised activity.” “those farmers who have grain stored on-farm have had a lengthy late harvest program and there just might not be the time to get a finishing enterprise set up.” birchip cropping group bcg livestock systems officer ali frischke said farmers considering the option needed to do their numbers carefully “you have to know your costs of production you have to know your growth rates and the feed conversion it is not just as simple as ‘i have some grain in the shed let’s feed it out to some lambs’ you have to know the economics of what you are doing.” she said mixed grain and livestock farmers had experienced success with opportunity feed-lotting before but added many utilised their stubbles primarily to finish lambs “many might find getting their lambs on the stubbles an easier way of value-adding their livestock.” she also urged farmers not to undervalue their own labour costs “you need to value your time and given many croppers will already be thinking about this year’s plant lot-feeding may be an idea that sounds good in theory but does not quite stack up.” she agreed with ms herbert that a lack of cheap store cattle and sheep was a key obstacle for would-be lot-feeders who do not already have animals “in others years people with cheap grain have managed to source sheep from other areas such as western australia where there were issues with dry conditions this year there is nowhere to source those sheep “overall wa is in good condition and the pastoral country on the east coast another potential source of sheep is also going well.” mr duddy said the high wool price was another roadblock to lot feeding sheep as merino wethers traditionally a low-cost option for opportunity lot-feeders were harder to come by “the high wool price is encouraging graziers to hang onto their merino wether lambs for wool whereas previously they have been part of the slaughter.” it all added up to an environment where good management was critical in his eyes “many producers can successfully finish merino lambs in feedlot systems however risks are generally high and margin for error low he said the story cheap grain but finishing opportunities limited first appeared on farm online talk.
